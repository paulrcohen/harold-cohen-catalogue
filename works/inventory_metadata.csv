Tom says: ""We now know 79SN1-Gazelli painting was shown at along side 79SN2-Tate at the 1979 Sierra Neveda Show. We will need to update the exhibit history. These photos were photographed by a Mark Toal. This this first time I have seen his name so I know nothing about him. I also found a group of 35mm B&amp;W film. These are photos of the computer terminal that was used to trace the 79SN2-Tate painting. I believe the 79SN2-Tate painting was painted at the Sierra Nevada Museum during the exhibit. Therefore, I now believe the one at Gazelli was also painted there. I need to verify the info on Tate at some point.

Initially, these artworks featured figures with occasional plant elements, notably the 1985’s <i>Untitled Bathers</i> series. In late 1986-87, full jungle scenes emerged and from the 1990s to 2004, portraits dominated with potted plants gradually introduced. From 2004 to 2007, a radical shift occurred, eliminating room context and emphasising plant dominance and colour. As a series, these artworks epitomise the new colouring strategy introduced by Cohen in 2006, and stylistically they would adapt from complex grass-like stems to underwater kelp gardens, following the removal of gravitalitional elements in 2008.",,0,#1/10,Dover street (location),,,,UNDER REVIEW,image_475.png

; 22 1/5 x 28 5/8 in
; ",Signed ,,"Turtle Era, paper is also mounted in a matte window and has a plexiglass cover - previously exhibited in this way and were mounted to the wall with small clear angle brackets.<br><br>NOTES FROM TOM MACHNIK (HCT) sent on Mon, 7 Nov 2022:<br>""Sara and I inventoried our Amsterdam Series of work we have in house and looked through other information in our archives and here are our findings.<br>First, there are 6 unique images that make up the Amsterdam Series. There is potential confusion because there are multiple naming conventions used to identify these same 6 images and to further complicate the matter none of the works were titled and some of the drawings were colored by hand but were not part of the Amsterdam B/W Drawing Series.<br>Here are a couple of the naming systems used. In our Visual Record System 77D1, 77D2, 77D3, 77D4, 77D5 and 77D6 were used and the V&amp;A uses A, B, C, D, E, F.<br>77D1 = V&amp;A Suite A77D2 = V&amp;A Suite B77D3 = V&amp;A Suite C...77D6 = V&amp;A Suite F<br>77D1, 77D2...77D6 were all signed as x/75 where x started with 1 and ended with 75. This would mean a maximum of 450 (6 * 75 = 450) signed Amsterdam Series images were intended to be produced and signed.<br>When it comes to the color images two different methods are used to identify the hand colored Amsterdam images. Like above, 77D1..77D6 was used but an additional letter was appended. For example 77D1a and 77D1b means two different hand colorings were used on the 77D1 drawing. While each colored drawing shares one of the six B/W Amsterdam drawings, each colored drawing has their own unique hand coloring. The works that were recorded in the visual record are the following 11 works. This may not be a comprehensive list as some of the records are missing from this time period. But it is believed to close to the entire list as only a few records are missing.<br>77D1a, 77D1b<br>77D2a, 77D2b77D3a, 77D3b, 77D3c77D4a, 77D4b77D5a77D6a<br>The hand colored work at the V&amp;A is not signed has 77 rather 82 and therefore does not have a corresponding number in the visual record from 1977. The works in 77 were hand colored with colored pencils. As for the hand coloring in 82 works, these were done with color dyes. The one at the V&amp;A is a hand colored dye work and usings 77D1 drawing as the underlying drawing.<br>Internally we also use an Artwork Ref ID to identify works especially Untitled ones. In the case of the one we sent you, this ID is ""Amsterdam Suite 11 Style #1""  and corresponds to 77D3a in the Visual Record. You may notice that next to 77D3a there is a 77D3b and 77D3c. This indicates there are two additional works using the same drawing but different use of coloring. In this case, these are Amsterdam Suite 11 Style #2 and Amsterdam Suite 11 Style #3. So just to be clear the use of 11 has to do more with the inventory and the way we generated the Artwork Ref and does not mean there was 11 different Suites. And with respect to rarity there were 3 works using the same underlying drawing 77D3 but each have different coloring.<br>With respect to the provenance. We were able to find some proof of which Amsterdam colored drawings were on display at Stedelijk in 1997. We have no evidence of Amsterdam Suite 11 Style #1 as being on display. It may have but we don't have evidence. We do have evidence of the following works shown at Stedelijk Museum in 1977 they are:Amsterdam Suite 11 Style #2  (77D3b)Amsterdam Suite 7<br>Amsterdam Suite 8bAmsterdam Suite 18<br>We have all of the above in our inventory. In addition, we have 4 Amsterdam Series signed B/W works in the studio and 25 unsigned works. Many of the unsigned works are not finished and look like a work in process as they are not cut ot size.<br>I know this is rather complicated and I apologize. In summary<br>There are 3 different years where Harold Cohen signed work for the Amsterdam Series.1977 there are B/W drawings and hand colored drawings colored with colored pencils1980 there are no B/W drawings and one hand colored drawing colored with colored pencils1982 there are no B/W drawings and 6 hand colored drawings colored with dyes<br>The Amsterdam work we sent you is 1 of 3 using the same underlying drawing but the coloring is unique.We are aware of 11 hand colored works from 1977. We currently have 6 signed 1977 hand colored works in our inventory and 1 hand colored work from 1980 and 6 from 1982. This is compared with 450 potential total B/W drawings. I say potential because I have no evidence that the entire 450 were actually produced. The number is probably much less. We currently have 4 B/W signed Amsterdam Series drawings from 1977.<br>We assume lithography was used as we have much of evidence showing that Cohen used lithography from time to time. We have direct evidence of lithography being used in 1980. We have yet to find direct evidence for 1977 but we also have no evidence to rule it out. The 1980 lithography work is similar in production to the 1977 work at that is our closest evidence.<br>I know these is too much information even though I reduced multiple times in hopes to improve it. Therefore, if you need any clarification please let me know.""<br><br><br>","45.1 x 59.1 cm
