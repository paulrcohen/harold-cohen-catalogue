Sorry for my delayed response as I was following up on another lead regarding the Director of Sunday Night: Five for Venice. 

I understand the ""Sunday Night: Five for Venice"" is no longer extant in your archives. I have since found some additional information which confirms what you wrote but also hope that maybe a copy still is extant. I understand the late Ann Turner (1927-2018) was the film director of the programme. In a voice recorded interviewed by Alan Lawson in 1995 she provides the details on the films demise where she says*(see note below), ""BBC One, I had a five for Venice on the 25th of October in 1966. I'd spent a year following around the British Council something we could never do these days. Actually, with the five artists concern, which are known as Tony Cairo, Danny Cairo, Robin Denny now CBE, the two Cohen's Harold and Bernard and Dick Smith and Lillian Somerville, Sir Herbert Read. David Thompson was involved as the catalogue was his. And I think it's a very interesting film. And I would very much like to see it except BBC lent it to Nancy for ?OU? thing. Humphrey had not signed the retention order. And the thing was junked with its negative when it came back to film library, Alan Hanson nearly went through the roof, because you know all those artists are important. And they were all in their studios talking about their work.""
That is a pity. But Ann Turner goes on to say later in the interview,""One of the things I have not followed up is if whether the British Council, I may simply have given them a copy with luck, they might have kept it you know.""  Do you have any thoughts on how I would approach the British Council to ask if they have a copy? 

Also regarding the other finds. This is wonderful news. What do we need to do to get a listing of sorts from you?"

I haven't listened to the whole lecture yet either but there are certainly some important points. FUN did a good job with filming HC's slides. Other lectures we have tend to have very poor quality captures of the slides or no slides at all. Also important was that HC showed AARON running at that time. It looks similar to KCAT but I have to study it more. I may be more like an post KCAT version.

The audio is muffled and I can’t make out the name exactly.  I know my mom remembers this lecture so I can ask her.  Mima also thanked Mr. Ito (again, not super sure), who is the president of the art department, as well as the Committee of International Relations (?) for inviting and helping fund the special lecture.  The theme of the lecture was “somthing something…Imagination in Art” or something like that? I can’t make out the first part.  I didn’t listen to the whole lecture, but it sounds great! The part in second video at about 48 min in during the Q &A is so interesting! 
Can I share the video with my mom to see if she remembers anything else pertinent?

Hi KanokoIf you a have a free moment can you look at the email below and go to the websitehttps://thinking-sketch.sakura.ne.jp/cohen/

I am working with Yoshiaki Mima regarding a lecture HC gave at Future University in Japan (FUN). It took a while but he graciously made the effort to convert it from tape and share the link but we have access now. The lecture is in English and sounds like it is being translated as he goes through the lecture. If you have some time can you listen at least to the beginning where they are speaking Japanese and where I assume they are introducing HC. And can you give me any important details like where they are. Who invited him. Why they are there etc. Or any other info you may think is pertinent.

Draft certificate from the Trust for the physical print
Draft Opensea Listing for the NFT with updated collection, wallet name, traits and description
Draft spreadsheet of NFTs with descriptions and dimensions
Draft spreadsheet of prints with descriptions and dimensions 
Draft Copy that needs your sign off as will be used by Sotheby’s in their outreach 

Please note we will need to provide you with the Verisart URLs for all the printed works as these will be certified separately from the NFTs and linked to from the NFT descriptions.

Please let us know if you require any changes as we would like to send across final copy for Sotheby’s by end of day your time. We will update NFT descriptions with any information we get from Tom in due course.

I think our best option is to tell the whole story. If we were stamp
collectors, errors like this would be worth a fortune. The story as I
understand it leaves no doubt that ""2002"" was an error. Here's the
evidence:

 - The left side of the print identifies the work as 03-11-32 (Tom,
 correct me if I misremember the order of the pairs), which means 2003,
 November, 32nd print of the year
 - Another print in the sale was printed at nearly the same time. On the
 left it says 03-11-35. On the right it says 2003.
 - Harold compiled a catalog of work in 2004. In that catalog, the print
 is given the date 2003.
 - We might be able to find an exhibition catalog that shows the print
 and gives it the date 2003. Tom is looking now.
 - Most importantly, Aaron simply couldn't have made this image in 2002.
 Tom's research shows that potted plants happened in 2003 and, notably,
 shadows didn't appear until the summer of 2003.

All this evidence and Harold's well-known inability to keep track of days
and dates leave no doubt in my mind that ""2002"" is an error. The Trust
can stand confidently behind this account. Far from raising questions
about the dates of the other prints, the research that went into resolving
this anomaly should convince Sotheby's and collectors that we are very
serious about the dates."

yes, once we know the entire list we can proceed with a scheduling. 
Typically they send someone out first to get a lay of the land and then 
based on that they then schedule the pick. And if two visits are 
necessary that's ok. I just hope we can minimize the window of time as 
much as possible as to when the art is ready to go here and when they 
pick it up. Thanks for your cooperation and hope you have a wonderful 
holiday season,

Thank you for the Harold Cohen print. Its perfect. The image fits right in to what Harold was doing when I was in the lab, and then the printing itself is very elegant. So greatly appreciated. 

Please give me some info: 

1. What year was the image made? 

2. When was it printed?

3. How, and on what paper? 

4. What is the yellow sticker mean i23-0577? should I remove if, if so, will it damage the print? 

Thank you, 

PS. I hope the codes you got are useful. They dont show how harold designed the drawing process but they show the interface between the PDP 11 and the Tektronix 4014. I will continue to search in the boxes. The location of this code was not apparent when Tom you came by as it was part of my tenure application at USC."

Hope all is well!
Paul, looking forward to our catch up Monday but in the meantime wanted to
touch base to let you know that the exhibition is up and open and getting a
lot of interest.

2 works have now been sold with another 3 being considered. Once the
physical exhibition is over on Tuesday, the sale will continue online.

There was an enquiry from one of the top NFT collectors re the actual
program producing these (some technical questions). Is there anything we
can share in addition to what has already been communicated ? Perhaps some
images of Harold’s sketchbook or anything you might think would be
relevant.

Some images here:

Appreciate that all this takes time and it’s sometimes hard to determine what happened so long ago.

Regarding this work, we now have two options:

1) We create a new certificate for the print and change the date from 2002 to 2003. The problem with this is that the collector would receive the print and may then ask why the year says 2002 whereas the record says 2003 and this may create further confusion and invite further scrutiny regarding dates written on other prints. I think we would want to avoid this as we are looking to build a trusted market for this works. We would also need to destroy the already minted NFT which states a production year of 2002 which is what is supplied although the file metadata does say 2003.

2) We leave the certificate for the print as it stands which states it was produced in 2002. We add a note to the certificate for the NFT to say this is the earliest known file the estate has for this work and say that the descriptor file was not saved until 2003. The benefit with this is we don't have to re-mint or re-issue the NFT or the certificate and we can simply amend the certificate for the NFT to reflect the above.

I suspect there may be other cases we come across when we put together the catalog raisonne and it may be better to include all works together in a series of changes the estate agrees upon than to introduce all this know on the eve, so to speak, of the selling exhibition with Sotheby’s.

We will do whatever you think is best but from our perspective we think Option 2 is preferable at this stage.

Grateful for your thoughts and guidance on this.

Best

If we want to piggyback and highlight the efforts you are currently doing (Gazelli) or plan to preview in the near future, maybe we have similar work here in the studio that is ready to hang and that is not part of the shipment to Gazelli.

Today I visited with, Nina, a former assistant of Harold’s. She worked with Harold in the late 80’s and early 90’s and was there when AARON began making portraits. I talked with her about the noose issue as well as some other facial choices/issues. As we did we came across some 8.5x11 laser prints of AARON portraits which she recognized as being generated during her time with Harold and explained Harold’s process at the time. Apparently, Harold would run AARON all night long and laser printer would run all night too printing everything AARON generated. In any case, I have more to look through. If I exhaust what we have in the studio, I will take you up on your offer and provide you what I am looking for. Thanks so much.
On another topic, several years ago, I came across a youtube video of AARON running on a monitor. Unfortunately, the youtuber did not provide any info on where the film was done was done. I reached out to the channel but never got a reply. As I am putting together a collection of all the known video instances of AARON running historically, it bothered me that this was a loose end. So yesterday on a whim, I revisited the youtube channel and looked through all the videos from the channel looking for hints and EUREKA! I found a website with your name on as curator!! So I knew I must be close. Ultimately I was able to determine the video was filmed at Shelia C Johnson Design Center’s “The Question of Intelligence AI and the Future of humanity.” 
Based on the video I can guess which version of AARON was running but ideally I get the date and/or file name that is running. As I see you were exhibition curator, do you have any idea how SJDC came across this version of AARON running and what version it is? Or do you know who I may contact who might help me?"

Nina confirmed her visit this coming Monday. Also briefly two recent discoveries. 
While looking for info related to Gordon Bell, I found a one page printout of Lisp code — undated of course. This printout is numbered page two. Page one is missing and the code is cut off at the bottom meaning it was at least 3 pages. Not sure if this is specifically related to AARON. The title of the code is doodle.lis and it seems to be a strategy for filling in areas. The flip side of the print out is a hand-written note addressed to Gordon and based on the content the date is 1995. So we have to assume to the printout is at that time or earlier.  
Another discovery was made by Sara. While cleaning a closet she found multiple boxes of photographs and 35mm slides with labels saying family photos. However, when I opened the first box, only the first four photographs were family photos. Probably from the 1960s. The photographs below these are b/w photos of 1960s artworks but they are more like notes in a way because some of them have marks on them like he is strategizing. And there is this photo showing Harold working on one of his mid 1960s works. These are the ones where he is implementing his rules. The photo is really quite interesting. He has the work on the floor and what looks like a cup of paint at the end of along broom handle. And he is holding it over the painting. Look quite fascinating.

Regarding the book, the cover looks like it is a reproduction of an Amsterdam lithography that was hand colored with colored pencils. I am in the middle of doing a major computer data backup which will take another 5 - 7 hours or so. After the backup, I will be able to access the files and determine if the cover is indeed an Amsterdam work. 

The last 35 pages of the book are a collection of AARON drawings that were generated from 1973 to 1982ish. Most  of the 35 drawings look familiar to me. I believe I scanned some of the original 35mm slides of them earlier this year. They too are in the process of being backed up and I am not sure if they condition of the scans are acceptable to being reproduced.
On page 127 of the book it reads, ""All the photographs in this book, and all the drawings which were not made by the program, were made by Becky Cohen.""
I am not exactly sure what Jeu de Paume's intent is or what is needed, but in case they simply need works from 1973 to 1983 then we should be able to provide them with something. I will know more after the backup is done. If they are referencing, the book then I rather think permission from William Kaufmann Inc is required

Hi both , 
They have now just requested to reproduce just the cover of the book (as realised it will take a little longer to get copyright for other elements of the book as originally intended). 
Would this work? (They are planning to have the title as “The first artificial colouring book” beside the image of the cover of the book.

 Dear Mila,When I go into the studio on Monday, I will look at the physical book. But I rather think the challenge is that the works published in the book may have been photographed by Becky. Hopefully, by reviewing the book that information will reveal itself. I am not sure what is meant by ""descriptions"" in the text ""works and descriptions relating to Harold"". In any case, I will review the book on Monday.

Dear Mila
Nice to hear from you.
I'm always happy to hear about interest in the colouring book as it is a treasure that has yet to reveal itself fully. 
Earlier this year we scanned the pages so from a practical stand point we have them. We've had multiple similar requests in the past but we had to decline each not because there are multiple authors meaning we do not have the copyright. 
I would love for Jeu de Paume to include portions of the book. But don't want HCT to get in legal trouble.

Sorry for the delay and thank you so much for your further research into
this Tom and your further thoughts Paul.
I wasn't able to get hold of Michael as planned on Friday, so am hoping to
get hold of him this pm (when New York wakes up) - ideally before our 3pm
(UK time) call Paul so I'll have something to update you with!

I think your suggested wording might be the one to stick with:
*Each work is from a unique, signed edition with no other editions
available with an accompanying ERC-721 token.*

I would argue that this statement is true at this present time.
If tomorrow comes, and there will be another edition (produced or found) to
sell with an accompanying ERC-721 token, only then the statement will be
false.

To further protect ourselves, we could word it as:
*Each work is from a unique, signed edition with no other editions
available with an accompanying ERC-721 token.*

I'll try and get hold of him before our call, Paul.
Hopefully we can still salvage this and apologies for the frustration
caused here - we did everything we could on our end.

More soon,
Mila

Thank you for your detailed explanation. That makes perfect sense—we’ll
mention both, as Eden serves as the overarching framework for all the
series and is referenced by Pamela McCorduck in her book.

Christie’s will officially announce the auction on February 7, with bidding
commencing on February 20. I’ll keep you posted as soon as the page goes

Please find attached a letter from Cambridge Trust Company which 
confirms the $10,000 but unfortunately it does not clearly state the 
painting name. But based on the date being close to the January 25, 1990 
date we can assume its the same painting. The letter is dated Feb 9, 
1990 but the check could have been issued Jan 25th or the 25th could 
have been the invoice date. In any case, I have exhausted the manila 
folders. There are other folders related to DEC and Gordon Bell but none 
have any references to the painting in question. Now that I have the 
Cambridge Trust Company name I can look and see tomorrow if we have any 
additional documents under that name. Regardless, of that outcome we can 
generate a document for you with the information we have.

The works at Documenta ’77 were ink on paper drawn by the Turtle. According to notes/correspondences from Harold, he claims they were given to schools. I have found no evidence of the potential names of the schools. Basically the same answer for the Stedlijk show also 1977. These too were works on paper given to schools yet to be located. 

As for the full color paintings that are not murals, there are 3:

 - 
RA26 now with Tate previously shown at they 1979 Reno Nevada show and also known as Reno 2 or AARON Drawing #1

 - 
RA40 sent to Gazelli also shown previously at Reno and known as Reno 1

 - 
RA46 now with Thoma not known to have been shown at a show prior to the Thoma acquisition – was shown on TV while in process of being painted

As for the 1979 SFMOMA show, two things were going on. One, the Turtle was making drawings on paper just like Stedlijk and Documenta. Two, the mural behind him was executed onsite. I don’t yet know what happened to the mural. We might have the mural panels in the studio or we might not. I did open one of the folded panels a few years ago. That panel looked like a panel from the early 1980s – possibly the one shown at the Tate in the early 1980s. It was certainly not 1979. I could try opening up other panels but it may need to wait as the only space to accommodate the size of these panels is the living room and the family has visitors this week. That is, unless, I can figure something else out. I hope we have it as that would explain what happened to the SFMOMA mural. I know this maybe a whole ‘nother’ can of worms but there are other pre-1980 murals. They may not necessarily be paintings on canvas but they may exist in public space. This is on our list to do but not much has been down towards that yet.

 Hi Tom, 
Many thanks for getting back to me. 
Apologies for any confusion. My question was: do you know if there are any of the large 'Turtle' paintings, aside from the Tate, in public/museum collections? I was wondering if any of the museum shows where he produced those works (image attached, SFMoMA 1979, for example) had kept them in their permanent collection. But if, as you say 'there are “no"" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows'. Then that's the answer. I'm curious what happened to them, but I guess they were destroyed and not acquired by the Museums at the time? 
Thanks for sending over such a detailed document of the work in the Tate collection too. I really appreciate the in-depth research. 
Thanks again,

Hi George,

I am not sure I understand the question correctly. So, just to be clear, of the three shows you mention, there are “no"" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows. 

If we are referring to canvas works, there were 3 executed after these shows. One is now at the Tate. One is with Thoma. And we sent you the 3rd one. We have a 4th canvas work that is black lines only in the studio – no coloring. I did a detailed investigation for Valentina Ravaglia of the Tate into their work (RA26) for their Electric Dreams which you can view here if interested. 

RA26 (Oct 1979) - A Deeper Look

Shortly after I began working for Harold, he had me destroy a canvas work which may have been from that same period. But I really don’t know. It might have been more recent. 

We have a tiny collection of early non-canvas works. These are folded cloth works. Some are multi-panel-mural works, others a single panel. I hope to get to document them this year. The time period range of these works is not known but I rather think they are late 1970s early 1980s. 

If there are additional works out there, I am not aware of them. When I looked into the details and origins of the Tate’s RA26, I did not come across any information suggesting more than the known 4 canvas works were executed in the 1977-1979 style of AARON. 

Hope that helps, if you need anything else let me know,

Tom

 Hi Tom and Paul, 
I hope you are both doing well? 
Aside from the Tate, do you know how many of the large Turtle paintings are in museum or public collections? Shows at that time include Documenta 6, group show (1977), Stedejilk, solo show (1977) and SFMoMA, solo (1979). 
Really appreciate your help, as always!

So there is a gap from 2001 to 2003 and 2003 happens to be the year of our focus. I image there must be some photographic prints some where to fill in the gap. I'm just not sure where that might be. 

In any case there are some photos from 2004 and other years, hopefully you can find something of use at this link,https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1FIG8PuAZZ1ckR7jjEZfpf9CYAHYyb2F8

Thanks for your time earlier. Per discussion we will go with:

1) the Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery
2) Use Harold Cohen Trust instead of HCT
3) We will use the file sizes as per the files themselves and not the file size in the Word Document you previously provided.
￼

Thanks for clarifying - we will pass this on to Sotheby’s.

that justifies the requirement.

We gave them an easy solution: Each print + JPEG is a unique entity, even
if there are other prints out there. If they choose to reject this

Hey Tom, lots to discuss here! We should have a call this week if possible. Very briefly:

 1. When I spoke with an accountant she said HCT should be a business, not a Trust
 2. I'm thinking about retiring from Pitt and moving to Boston (where Allegra and Hitch are) and focusing on the startup, HCT and writing (keep this to yourself please)
 3. I have started the complicated accounting that will enable HCT to file taxes, but it's gonna take a while"

Following your notes, they got inspired and suggested to include a revised
caption as per below:

Computer-generated drawing (1976-1978) by Harold Cohen, University of
California, San Diego. The drawing was probably made with the help of his
artificial intelligence AARON that was published first in 1979.

If this won’t work, then they will include the original plus the date:
Computer-generated drawing (1976-1978) by Harold Cohen, University of
California, San Diego.

I believe the original plus the date works better but let me know what you
think!

My best,

We shot this video footage over a year ago and it got a wall until I hired
a pro editor to pull a story out of 12 hours or so of footage shot on
phones and multiple camera ms.

Battles with peaking audio, auto white balance challenges and way too much
material and here we are!

I’m happy with this and I’ve watched this many many times with the editor
it is time to publish. We are working on the subtitles and then it will be
ready to go live sometime this week.

I’ll ping you again when it’s live so you can broadcast it to your family
friends and network but wanted to give you the sneak peek.

 Hi both,
Many thanks for all this.I've put the IAG works and all the info we currently have on the prints in the second tab of our 'master spreadsheet'. Please disregard our inventory numbers for now (some are duplicated for internal purposes) and the internal notes in the Note column. The rest should be accurate.

Paul, I agree we should identify a reference folio that will not be for sale.
Tom, can you confirm you have the complete set of edition 2/10 for the whole folio (1-12) framed or unframed, and 3/10? Is it possible that other edition numbers will come up from this folio, or highly unlikely?
So far we have sold: #4 edition ; #6 edition and #9 edition all numbers 1/10 We have paused any offerings from the series for now till we decide on the best way forward.
So for the non-reference folio, available to sell, we could hold back on say edition 2/10 for each of the images in this folio (1-12) and/or 3/10 (if that is a full series too), and are able to sell the rest?
My best,Mila



Folks, here's a thought about strategy for folios.  Please let me know what you think:

Define a folio to be a collection of prints that have some coherence (e.g., AG1 - AG12)
Define a reference folio to be a folio that can be used as reference material for reprinting or by scholars etc.  Note that a reference folio can contain damaged works provided the damage does not prevent the reference material being used as intended.  Note also that a reference folio need not be signed. 

As with individual works, we should never sell the reference folio.
That's the easy part. Now the harder part concerns selling work from nonreference folios.  Here we need guidance from Mila.  I think we could make the argument that we should not break up the last of a folio, unless the prices warrant it or there is no prospect of selling the entire folio as a unit. Suppose we have two copies of a folio (e.g., two undamaged copies of each of the 12 prints in AG), then I would argue that we can sell from one of these folios. 

What do you think?"

We have been approached by two separate people looking to
authenticate/certify these works.
We do not have anything more than just these images to go by.
Although we do know that two of them came from an estate sale from a few
weeks ago (in SF Bay Area).

[image: 20241001_130854.jpg][image: 20241001_125308.jpg]

I don't know if the images only are enough to have them authenticated, but
we suggest getting back to them with the following:
We can only authenticate works that come to us directly from the HCT.

Going forward, what do you think should be our process here?
We can certainly tackle this once the catalogue raisonne is under way -
this is both on the backend, having each work blockchain certified and
having a clear idea of the existence of each work, even if not physically
located at the studio.

Speak soon,
Mila"

Nice to meet you virtually. I appreciate you taking a moment to read my 
request. My name is Tom Machnik. I am the Art Studio Manager for the 
Harold Cohen Trust. Susan Grabowski reached out to us about a year or so 
ago regarding a project she is spearheading and we joyfully contributed 
to her project. She connected me to you because I asked about the 
following related to research I am doing that involves HNF and the 
people there.

I am currently piecing together Cohen/AARON works and history during his 
transitional period from his Painting Machine Era to his use of 
Commercial wide format printers (approximately from 1998 to 2002). We 
have limited archival documents from that time, but we do have a 
correspondence whereby Cohen discusses with Andreas Schulze an upcoming 
show at HNF. Based on HNF's website there does seem to have been a show 
there in Feb 2002. Our communications suggest some event may have also 
occurred at HNF in Fall of 2001. Based on our documents HNF may have 
been involved in the actual production of these works. As these HNF 
shows/events may have been the first international public showing from 
Cohen/AARON after his Painting Machine Era, they are of much interest to 
the Trust. Since we seem to be missing details regarding this show, I am 
seeking to connect with Andreas Schulze or anyone who may have been 
involved with Cohen either directly or indirectly. If you can connect me 
with anyone, that would be wonderful.

Much appreciation for your time. I wish you well."

Many thanks for all this.
I've put the IAG works and all the info we currently have on the prints in
the second tab of our 'master spreadsheet'. Please disregard our inventory
numbers for now (some are duplicated for internal purposes) and the
internal notes in the Note column. The rest should be accurate.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wQm-yFS2XEvoDG4UmGXDl4j0M9bmOtG4/edit?pli=1&gid=488731888#gid=488731888

Paul, I agree we should identify a reference folio that will not be for
sale.

Tom, can you confirm you have the complete set of edition 2/10 for the
whole folio (1-12) framed or unframed, and 3/10?
Is it possible that other edition numbers will come up from this folio, or
highly unlikely?

So far we have sold: #4 edition ; #6 edition and #9 edition all numbers
1/10
We have paused any offerings from the series for now till we decide on the
best way forward.

So for the non-reference folio, available to sell, we could hold back on
say edition 2/10 for each of the images in this folio (1-12) and/or 3/10
(if that is a full series too), and are able to sell the rest?

My best,
Mila

Of course during Sep most of the effort was toward the Sotheby's Oct 2024 project. We learned much because of the endeavor. One the things I learned was that our digital records need to be all collected and put all onto one storage device. Previously I collected the source code and put that all on one storage device. But the AARON generated artwork, HC correspondences, notes and other files were not. When it came to researching the Sotheby project it because obvious that we need to copy all of what we have into ideally one storage media. And that media should have multiple backups. This is what my primary focus is now and where most of my time is being spent. I am currently pulling all the original storage devices and copying everything to make the initial master copy. Ideally it would be sorted and such but that can be done as needed. For now I need to copy everything while things still work.

Hope you are well.  Hoping to get some preliminary background on the possibility of an idea Paul mentioned.  How close to a mural-size work do you think your plotters could plot? Is 48 or 60 inch wide paper a possibility? Is even larger, say 8 or 10 ft possible? And instead having a person manually mount each sheet like at the Whitney, is it possible to have a roll of paper? Like, say a 60” x 100 foot roll or 48” x 350 ft? Or multiple rolls? And plot maybe a 60x48inch area at a time. And then advance the roll for the next plot? Or could it somehow plot an area, whatever size that maybe, and then, move to another area and plot that other area. And move about across whatever space is available to complete the work? And maybe more importantly than the size… could all of this be done vertically? This may be a bit ambitious, but in a sense, I am asking how close do you think you could get to making a vertical turtle that would execute multiple murals and do so with minimal human intervention. And however close that might be, what would that look like?"

Sorry about the delay. Yesterday, I was at a good friend of Harold’s yesterday doing inventory of their collection of Cohen/AARON works which turns out the collection spans the time period from 1971 to 2012. The 1971 work is one of the original LACMA Maze drawings that were executed and mail out as invitations to the 1972 show. Another important discovery is that they have one of the panels from an important piece titled “The Age of Intelligent Machines (1986).” We have two of the panels in the studio but I have long wondered why one was missing. Now I know where that is! 
In any case, you are interested in more recent works. The only information I have of 1991-1999 works being in collections is for Robert Hendel and Frank Dictrich. You are right ""Stephanie and Friend” is with Whitney now but originally was with Robert Hendel’s collection. In addition to Stephanie and Friend, Hendel has or had multiple works from this time period. My understanding is that he was ok with the Whitney taking the other Cohen/AARON works in his collection but the Whitney does not accept entire private collections or something to that effect. So it is possible that additional works from this time period in his collection were sent to other museums.  Dictrich seems to have had only one work a 1997 piece and I don’t have any info on who he is yet. I don’t see any museums listed. I will look some more today but want to get this to you sooner than later,
I understand, your last official day is tomorrow. Feel free to keep in touch beyond that time. I wish you much luck in your future and look forward to the time with our paths will cross again.

I've got what will hopefully be a quick question. Do you know which museums have AARON/Cohen's figurative works on canvas in their collection? Similar series and period as this one in the Whitney collection (Stephanie and Friends) https://whitney.org/collection/works/67981

Regarding what was made by the Turtle and your question: ""And the only large scale drawings made by the Turtle were on paper? ""
Short Answer YES
Detailed AnswerThe actual Turtle did not drawn directly on canvas. Instead, the Turtle made marks on photographic backdrop paper cut to size approximately 8 x 16 feet. Some were colored by school children. The works were composed by AARON and drawn using the Turtle. Drawing was executed on the floor and the computer guided the Turtle remotely with no human intervention. The Turtle’s position was relayed back to the computer using ultrasonic navigation.  I am working on a project called AARON Running. It is a collection of videos and animations showing AARON composing works while running on a computer. While my project is a in process, you can take a sneak peak at the link below. If you go to slide 4 you can see the a slide sequence animation of the Turtle drawing and thereby see how an AARON composition was drawn by the Turtle. I also have on slide 5 a 1980 video of AARON composing a Turtle Era work on screen. While it is not 1977 or 1979 it still demonstrates how AARON would have composed similar works.
 https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k6Ba5DNmJyEXRy761WeI1HzeYoz6JZ87NdS9GwJTHf0/edit?usp=sharing 
Regarding the murals and your question just so I'm clear: these are mural panels made of wood, hand painted by Harold, and not made by the Turtle at all? 
Short Answer Turtle was not used in the making of any mural
Detailed AnswerThe murals in the studio are large cloth panels (not canvas and not wood panels). They are folded cloth sheets, bundled together and wrapped in plastic and taped up. The panels were stuck together using velcro. There were a dozen+ public commission murals executed onsite including UCSD, Stanford, Digital Equipment and others. I don’t know too much about the base material for these. None of these are in the studio. The Turtle was not used in the making of any mural. They were, like you say, hand-painted. 
Regarding the execution of the work at Gazelli and your questionThere are only three examples of the large scale drawings on canvas (like the one we have), but they were also painted by Harold from B+W negatives projected, not made by the Turtle either? Short Answer Correct Detailed AnswerWith respect to the execution of the 3 canvases including the one at Gazelli, AARON was responsible for the composition of the line drawing. Six negatives were made of the composition — split into upper left, middle upper, upper right and 3 more for the bottom. The canvas was stapled to the wall at his UCSD studio. The film based images were projected onto the canvas and hand traced. The color composition and color choices were decided, mixed and applied by Harold Cohen. 
SummaryTurtle works => paper only — AARON Composed executed by Turtle Canvas & Mural works => non-paper — AARON Composed executed by hand
If you need any thing else or further clarification let me know,Tom

 Hi George,I have an additional comment. Although, it is more like a question mark. Below are two photos. The first one (0394A RA26) with the tire swing shape behind Harold is the one now at the Tate. The second one (Slide-0394b no RA) is unidentified.  As my research focus for Valentina Ravaglia was to clarify the title of the work, I did not research more deeply about the unidentified one. I would like to think the unidentified one was the one Harold asked me to destroy sometime ago. If not, then this a question mark.

George,

The works at Documenta ’77 were ink on paper drawn by the Turtle. According to notes/correspondences from Harold, he claims they were given to schools. I have found no evidence of the potential names of the schools. Basically the same answer for the Stedlijk show also 1977. These too were works on paper given to schools yet to be located. 

As for the full color paintings that are not murals, there are 3:

 - 
RA26 now with Tate previously shown at they 1979 Reno Nevada show and also known as Reno 2 or AARON Drawing #1

 - 
RA40 sent to Gazelli also shown previously at Reno and known as Reno 1

 - 
RA46 now with Thoma not known to have been shown at a show prior to the Thoma acquisition – was shown on TV while in process of being painted

As for the 1979 SFMOMA show, two things were going on. One, the Turtle was making drawings on paper just like Stedlijk and Documenta. Two, the mural behind him was executed onsite. I don’t yet know what happened to the mural. We might have the mural panels in the studio or we might not. I did open one of the folded panels a few years ago. That panel looked like a panel from the early 1980s – possibly the one shown at the Tate in the early 1980s. It was certainly not 1979. I could try opening up other panels but it may need to wait as the only space to accommodate the size of these panels is the living room and the family has visitors this week. That is, unless, I can figure something else out. I hope we have it as that would explain what happened to the SFMOMA mural. I know this maybe a whole ‘nother’ can of worms but there are other pre-1980 murals. They may not necessarily be paintings on canvas but they may exist in public space. This is on our list to do but not much has been down towards that yet.

 Hi Tom, 
Many thanks for getting back to me. 
Apologies for any confusion. My question was: do you know if there are any of the large 'Turtle' paintings, aside from the Tate, in public/museum collections? I was wondering if any of the museum shows where he produced those works (image attached, SFMoMA 1979, for example) had kept them in their permanent collection. But if, as you say 'there are “no"" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows'. Then that's the answer. I'm curious what happened to them, but I guess they were destroyed and not acquired by the Museums at the time? 
Thanks for sending over such a detailed document of the work in the Tate collection too. I really appreciate the in-depth research. 
Thanks again, 
George

Hi George,

I am not sure I understand the question correctly. So, just to be clear, of the three shows you mention, there are “no"" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows. 

If we are referring to canvas works, there were 3 executed after these shows. One is now at the Tate. One is with Thoma. And we sent you the 3rd one. We have a 4th canvas work that is black lines only in the studio – no coloring. I did a detailed investigation for Valentina Ravaglia of the Tate into their work (RA26) for their Electric Dreams which you can view here if interested. 

RA26 (Oct 1979) - A Deeper Look

Shortly after I began working for Harold, he had me destroy a canvas work which may have been from that same period. But I really don’t know. It might have been more recent. 

We have a tiny collection of early non-canvas works. These are folded cloth works. Some are multi-panel-mural works, others a single panel. I hope to get to document them this year. The time period range of these works is not known but I rather think they are late 1970s early 1980s. 

If there are additional works out there, I am not aware of them. When I looked into the details and origins of the Tate’s RA26, I did not come across any information suggesting more than the known 4 canvas works were executed in the 1977-1979 style of AARON. 

Hope that helps, if you need anything else let me know,

Tom

 Hi Tom and Paul, 
I hope you are both doing well? 
Aside from the Tate, do you know how many of the large Turtle paintings are in museum or public collections? Shows at that time include Documenta 6, group show (1977), Stedejilk, solo show (1977) and SFMoMA, solo (1979). 
Really appreciate your help, as always!

Seems like Gazelli is shutdown for the remaining of the year. Hopefully shortly after they return will finish hammering out the list of items to be shipped and then ship them the items. 

I reached out to Roger (our printer) regarding paying him and waiting a reply. I reviewed the work he did again and it really quite good.
I know you want to submit a potential list of code for the Whitney and with our last conversion we talked about what criteria the Whitney would be looking for. I have been thinking about what they have and what they don't have. They have KCAT and Gijon. 

Here are the main AASC groupings we have and where KCAT and Gijon belong
Group-A. 2013 - 2016 Fingerpainting EraGroup-B. 2009 - 2013 Collaborating with my other SelfGroup-C. 2007 - 2009 Gijon belongs hereGroup-D. 2000 - 2005 KCAT belongs hereGroup-E. 1995 - 1997 Painting Machine EraGroup-F.  1992 - 1995 Early LISP fragments 
Group-G  Paper Code various dates
Group-H  Film Code various dates

Of the main groups, the Whitney already has code representing Group-C and -D. That leaves Group-A, -B, & -E thru -H
 Group-A. 2013 - 2016 Fingerpainting Era
I have a collection of videos for Group-A Fingerpainting Era of the code running. There are 8 runnable versions. They all look similar in that they all make black and white drawings. They are all studio versions meaning they all generate AARON artwork intended for use in the studio and for the Fingerpainting Machine. The files it generates are in non-standard viewable file format. They are readable by the Fingerpainting Machine.

Thank-you for your interest in Harold Cohen’s work and for your introduction. I recall working with Sheldon Brown on the 2017 UCSD show ""Creating Computational Creativity.” I was also worked on Harold’s 2011 show ""Collaborations with my other self.”  And it was during the prep for the show I met Sheldon for the first time.
It seems you have already done some planning. I have a couple initial questions. Do you have a time frame for the show? With respect to creating a special exhibition while getting some art history grads involved, has there been any discussion on how that would shape the exhibition content? In other words, are you considering a historical dive?
I am currently working on resolving multiple Harold Cohen mysteries. One of these mysteries has to do with his 1976 mural titled “Drawing for Machine and Four Hands” executed at UCSD — a very early AARON work in a public space. Unfortunately, I unable to find any photos in our archive of the completed work — only a few cropped segments. Does this work still exist on campus? Who would I contact at UCSD regarding any possible historical photos of this work? 
Also in our archives are mentions of Faculty shows but very little info on the works shown. There was a mention of a 1968 Fall show for example. This would have been just weeks after arriving to the campus. What was shown at that time? There are many other UCSD shows he participated in as well. Also in our archives is a mention of a 1995 Machine Painting being on loan to the UCSD Chancellor’s office (TCM#38). Is that still there? 
I mention these because I am wondering if the direction you are pursuing is to highlight Harold’s direct contributions to UCSD. Harold built multiple drawing machines and painting machines and the turtle with much grow and development happened on the campus over time. And while AARON may have come to life at Stanford, it seems our oldest screen captures of AARON works are when Harold was here in San Diego and connecting to the Stanford computer via telephone line thereby running AARON remotely. This was 1975. And of course there are multiple high end computers he used on campus and helped acquire. That is another mystery... what happened to the various computer equipment. We have photos and video of these older systems using open reel tapes and removable hard drives. What happened to media? Do they still exist somewhere and if so, is there any code on any of the media or in printed form? Speaking of video and photos what additional media does UCSD have? Are you thinking in this direction? Or something else especially with respect to involving the art history grad.

Regarding a potential zoom meeting, can you provide some potential times, dates and expected length of time. If we were to pull the Director of The Harold Cohen Trust — Paul Cohen — we need to keep in mind he is on the east coast. 
Looking forward to hearing more. And hope at some point some of my questions can be answered."

Have a few separate topics to send over to you (as well as getting back to
you re IAG) so bear with me.

This one's a particular request that I wondered if you have anything in
your records for - did Harold Cohen ever have an official Chinese name?
Perhaps from any exhibitions in the region they've translated his name as.
It's from the Taikang museum, who are featuring Harold Cohen's work in a
show William Latham is curating, opening next month. They are distributing
material in two languages so want to make sure it matches what is already
out there. I tried searching for it but nothing came up.

Below are two links. One is to the Providence + Metadata document. The other is a link to the file folder to make the NFTs. I know that previously I sent the files for the NFTs but if possible please use these because I used these files to extract the metadata. While most of them are the same, there are some slight differences. So if possible, please use the ones in the link below.

I was not sure how to word some of the Providence events so if necessary you can change it so long as the events are intact. I was not sure how to word what ""aa"" files are. Internally, I typically refer to them as AARON Vector files but the more I thought about it the more I realized that AARON vector files are really the generation before where the vector (black line drawing file) and color file were two different files. The aa files have additional information on how to make the artwork besides just vectors. Keeping that in mind I used ""AARON Artwork descriptor file"" instead of AARON Artwork vector file. I would prefer to reserve the term AARON Artwork vector file for the drawing files that truly are lists of vectors.
As mentioned earlier, all of the jpegs were made by Harold at a later date. I found those dates and included them on the second line. The last line I listed that the file name was changed. We don't exactly know how he created the jpegs so I had to be vague about the process and simply put the date followed by, ""Harold Cohen completes jpeg conversion, names file"" then put the file name.
There was one jpeg that was corrupted. We currently do not have a way to convert aa files into jpegs. Fortunately, we have a Postscript file of the same work that was generated within one minute of the original aa file. I used the postscript file to make a jpeg file. So in this instance, there is no aa file listed since it was not directly involved in the making the jpg. I included my name as the one who made the conversion in case that is relevant. But can be removed with no skin off my back. In the case of the file name changes, I simply put HCT changed the names.
Regarding the Metadata, some files have much more metadata available than others. I chose to limit some of the metadata so as to keep the group basically the same. 

There was much data to enter by hand. I have checked it multiple times but after a good night sleep will check it one last time. If you find any inconsistencies, feel free to correct or ask me about it, Tom

I hope your year is off to a good start and that you are involved with exciting enjoyable efforts. Hard to believe a year has past already since we were there with you at your incredible Whitney evident for Harold and his AARON. 
I am currently working on identifying AARON works executed during the Harold’s transition period away from the painting machine toward his use of wide-format commercial printers (1998-2002). At the moment, I am focusing on Harolds year 2000 efforts — just prior to KCAT’s release. There is this one digital image that seems like an outlier. Based on the imagery it seems to belong to June of 2000 except for one stylistic feature — the nose.  
I know that after the initial KCAT release, Harold began an effort to remove all the black lines. The earliest dated evidence I have seen of the lines being removed is May 2001. This artwork has no people though. The earliest dated evidence we have of people without the line drawing is Oct of 2001. After Oct 2001, the lines are completely gone until 2012. 
I recall Harold commenting in particular about the line used to make the nose and how to handle its removal. From that view point it might be possible that the work in question was a kind of transitional/experiment work of his. A transitional work that would be post KCAT and pre-line removal. And if so, maybe he used an earlier 2000 AARON version to do an experiment. This is just a guess. Ideally, I find other examples of this nose prior to May 2001. 
When I look through our people with faces works (1990’s to 2001), I have yet to find a nose like this one. AARON did have the capacity to generate a wide range of variety and I haven’t necessarily seen the extent of its variety. Your Whitney show did produce a large number of works. In fact we have many of them here in the studio. I believe looking through this collection will help me resolve this issue and possibly others to come. 
We do plan on photographing the works you sent to us sometime in the future, I am wondering if there is a way to look through the Whitney KCAT collection without having to do so physically and prior to photographing them.
I would appreciate any thoughts you have on this matter."

Apologies - to give a bit more context, I'm in the early stages of
developing a documentary on Harold and his journey with AARON, i've become
fascinated with not only how ahead of his time he was in his practice but
also the originality and beauty of the art and how thoughtfully he shared
his thinking with essays and interviews. I'm working on this with Alan
Yentob, the former Head of Arts and Music at the BBC and host/producer of
the BAFTA award winning arts documentary series *Imagine
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(TV_series)>*.

I have read all of the essays, books and content that is in the public
domain about Harold but would welcome a call with yourself to get the
behind the scenes perspective on his collaborations with AARON.

No immediate rush, happy to schedule something for mid-January after the
holiday season is passed? Whatever is most convenient for you.

All the best,
Joel

It was a real pleasure to meet yesterday evening at the Electric Dreams
opening.

As I mentioned I am a big admirer of Harolds work and have so enjoyed
digging into his various writings and the context of his work and journey
with AARON.

I am also eager to share his pioneering story with the world and am in the
early stages of developing a documentary with the former Head of Arts and
Music at the BBC.

Paul - you kindly mentioned sharing the contact information of Harolds
studio assistant, i'm sure they would be a fantastic help as we start to
flesh out the material."

Dear Mila
Nice to hear from you.
I'm always happy to hear about interest in the colouring book as it is a treasure that has yet to reveal itself fully. 
Earlier this year we scanned the pages so from a practical stand point we have them. We've had multiple similar requests in the past but we had to decline each not because there are multiple authors meaning we do not have the copyright. 
I would love for Jeu de Paume to include portions of the book. But don't want HCT to get in legal trouble.

I just learned of this opportunity from the Schmidt Sciences <https://schmidtsciences.smapply.io/prog/humanities_and_artificial_intelligence_virtual_institute_havi_/> foundation. A few months ago I proposed to one of the LLM companies a “21st Century Catalogue Raisonne” built around Harold. That proposal looks like it will go forward, but slowly, so I am proposing the same to Schmidt, except I want to build something not just for Harold’s CR but for any artist who wants it. I am trying to assemble a consortium of experts on very short notice and I am hoping that I can tempt you to participate. Christiane Paul and Mila are on board, as are Bre Pettis and Tom Machnik. I’m trying to get in touch with Pip Laurensen but no luck so far. 

The pre-proposal is due on Friday. It’s only three pages and is well in hand. I wouldn’t need anything from you until they accept the pre-proposal and give us 60 days to write the full proposal. I have attached the original proposal to the LLM company (please don’t share it) to give you a sense of what the Schmidt pre-proposal will say. 

I do hope you can participate, I think this could be a really interesting project.

Thanks! —Paul￼

Thank you for your patience.
Attached here are two documents:

1) The certificate of insurance for the artworks.
This certificate specifically covers the works while in transit.
If you would like a copy of the another certificate that covers them while
they are stored / exhibited under the general policy, I can arrange one for
this also.

2) A copy of the Full inventory of works and insurance values that were
used for the the creation of the Certificate of insurance (including GAH's
reference numbers).

If you need more details at all, kindly let me know.

Michael.

Yes, Harold did exhibit in Texas as part of a touring exhibition called “Mapped Art” curated by Peter Frank. Mapped Art toured from 1982 to 1990 and the Austin, Texas leg was the last one. I am not sure what piece or pieces toured. But I believe one piece was of a pre-AARON Map style work of Harold's. Possible a labelled Map work from the early 1970ish. I might be able to dig that information out if need be. 
BTW, Harold’s pieces owned by Thoma exhibited in their Santa Fe, New Mexico Gallery. Thoma may have a facility in Texas but as far as I know Harold/AARON has not exhibited in Texas with Thoma.
Here is the list of exhibitions related to Mapped Art along with the dates. It was curated by And below that is a link to the 
""Mapped Art” 
University of Colorado Art Gallery (May 2, 1992 to Jun 7, 1982)Toledo Museum of Art (Nov 13, 1982 - Jan 2, 1983)Arkansas Arts Center ((Aug 7, 1987 - Sep 20, 1987)University of Texas Art Gallery, Austin (Aug 31, 1990 - Oct 17, 1990)

Hope you are both doing well? I'm doing some research on any connections between Harold and Texas but drawing a bit of a blank... I am looking for any shows he might've had or any collections there. I can't see anything obvious from the CV we have, but perhaps you might know?

I do plan to be out of town a few days +/- Jan 7th but I think the general time frame of early next year is doable. 

Regarding additional works, there are no additional canvas paintings that fit the 6 parameters. 
As for a pickup. I am currently reorganizing the remaining 15 drawers of works yet to be inventoried so that they are grouped into logical groups and not just strewn wherever. Once the work to be shipped is pulled, ideally it is picked up in a timely manner. It would be helpful to know if the shipper will need the studio space for preparing the work to be shipped. That would help me determine how much other work I can have out in order to continue the grouping process.

A few of the drawers do not have artwork but rather other artifacts. One in particular has posters from some of Harold's 1983 exhibitions. Might we send a few of these at this time? We multiple duplicates of these posters all in excellent condition:Brooklyn Museum 
Tate
Arnolfini 
National Museum of Wales 

Also, I know this is not part of the works that fit the 6 parameters, but we have a group of large sized wood framed prints behind plexi-glass that have to sit on the studio floor as we don't have a proper place to store them and they are slowly getting damaged. Some are from the same time period as they ones auctioned off this past fall. Others are more recent like 2010 or so. One of them is a signed Machine Painting. I am assuming the Machine Painting will go. I am wondering if some or all of the others should go at this time. There are 8 of them. All of them are signed works."

Dear Jeremy,
Regarding a date, will you be sending someone prior to collection to assess the care requirements? For example we have a number of large dye on paper works that or loose and will need pre-packing before shipping. We have other works that are order an in need of pre-packing TLC.  The studio is behind the home of family that is part of the Trust. We need to limit the time between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm. If you are able to do pre-packing onsite and complete the work all on one day between those times Monday June 16th is available."

To answer your question, there are 10 works. See details below. I know it is a challenge to tell by the photo, but the work on page 7* was previously sent to GAH in 2023.  So instead of 11, it is 10. If you include the 3 works we sent to GAH in 2023, then the total is 13. The omitted works are either part of the family collection or misplaced. I might be able to find the misplaced one but it would require an unknown amount of time. I hope the columns in the table below lines up ok.

We didn't photograph the KCAT images we selected for our archives but maybe we could retrieve them from storage and look through them in a Zoom meeting with you?

Yes, by breaking I mean we would no longer have 2 of each. I was 
thinking that if in the future someone would want to acquire the entire

one. I know that leaves one but that would make it the last one and we

Re_ San Diego Airport Temporary Exhibition Check In - Thomas Machnik <zipnpup@yahoo.com> - 2025-06-03 1713.eml,Re: San Diego Airport Temporary Exhibition Check In,Thomas Machnik <zipnpup@yahoo.com>,Dennert Daniel <ddennert@san.org>,"Paul Cohen <paulrcohen@gmail.com>, Tiffany Beres <tberes@san.org>",2025-06-03 21:13:06,"Tue, 3 Jun 2025 21:13:06 +0000 (UTC)",<209979661.2500981.1748985187038@mail.yahoo.com>,"Hi DanielHappy Tuesday, I am looking at the possibility of showcasing some of Harold’s earliest computer works as our main focus. These early works were executed here in San Diego in the late 1960s early 1970s. I’m thinking this would be a good way to introduce the passengers to the fact that some of the earliest computer composed art was done right here in San Diego as it was here where Harold began to utilize the computer to further develop himself and his art.  
So with respect to my question “hang-ready,” I was referring to some of these older works. Some of these older works are on Calcomp plotter paper  which are very light and flimsy. They are not behind a matte and not in a frame. They are basically loose and in some cases long strips of multiple images. We do have one older canvas work that is stretched but all the other canvas works from that time are rolled up and not stretched. We also have film negatives that are photos of works generated on the screen. These could be scanned and put in a slide show but I would like to have a couple original film strips on display. This would require backlighting of some sort. So basically, I was asking how about the division of effort. What effort do we need to do vs what you are able to do to have the works presented properly. If I understand you correctly, you do have some resources to assist us and that we don’t necessarily need to have everything ready to go. 
With respect to the computer/monitor behind glass, thanks for sharing the sound situation there. As part of the earliest-computer-works theme, and as an alternative to plotting works on paper, I was considering running our early 1970s reconstructed Maze program and generating works to a screen. Typically we would run this live, thus, generating works never before seen. However, because there would be no one there monitoring the computer in case of a computer crash, I am looking at generating the works prior to the show, recording them in advance and basically playing them back like a video. Not sure the Trust would be ok with that because we almost always do live generated work. Therefore, I am wondering if it were possible for us to monitor a live display remotely and/or generate the works remotely and then basically feed them via internet to the machine there at the airport? If we go with the case of a live feed of the reconstructed Maze program, we might provide a QR Code so the passengers can follow along on their phone. 
Also, I am considering sharing some of the early correspondences, notebook sketches and possibly photos of additional works or artifacts from that time. These could be either on display there or made into slide a presentation or a mix of both. 
One last comment or more like a question, if a passenger happened to want to purchase a Maze work onsite at the airport, is that a possibility?"

We are pretty open to finding the best work we are able to feature, and then supporting the process to display it. I'm not sure entirely what you mean by ""hang-ready,"" but I do believe we could support some fabrication or purchasing of mounts, etc. if needed. It would be ideal to understand the artwork you are thinking about.

The case does not have any particular restrictions. I will note, hanging from the ceiling of the case is difficult for anything that is of significant weight.

To my knowledge we have never displayed a screen behind the glass. The glass does have some reflection due to the number of windows in the space. That would be something we would want to consider if we did want to mount a digital display in the case. All our monitors have speakers built into them. I have not listened to the sound levels from behind glassbut my instinct is, we may want to lean toward using captions. There is presently overhead music in the space, which, I could look into having turned off, but I don't think it could be turned off for the entire year.

Thanks,
Daniel

Dear Daniel,
Thank-you for the dimensions, the photos and additional details. Yes, it they are helpful. With respect to hanging work, please let me know if this is correct, I am assuming our artwork must be hang-ready and that you provide whatever is necessary from your end to hang the hang-ready works. And if this is the case are there some kind of restrictions I should be aware of besides depth considerations and the reduced height due to lighting? One last question, have you ever had a screen display mounted in one of the glass cases? If so, is audio permitted?

Tom



Hi Tom,

Happy to share some specs for the two glass case areas we discussed.

I am attaching a document that outlines the dimensions for the single case at Checkpoint 6, and the four cases at Gate 51. Please only use these dimensions.

Checkpoint 6
Please note that we added power outlets (2 plugs each) on the left and right sides of this case. There are LED track lighting that reduces the usable top and bottom margins of the cases by about 8"". These are moveable track light. They are not technically adjustable. They have some give, but are essentially up/down light.

Gate 51
We just added outlets to these cases as well. There is one single plug in the two small cases. There are two single plugs on either side of the larger cases. The lighting is fixed downlight only. It can be turned off separately from the electricity in the case.

Contracting
If we were able to work together to determine items that are available for loan and create a final display plan together, we believe it is likely we could enter into a sole-source agreement with you so you didn't need to go through the standard adjudication process. However, I believe we would need to get a real head start on that in the next month or so, in terms of what is possible.

Is this enough information? Is there anything further I can provide, or would you be open to a studio visit to continue the conversation, if that is easier?

Thanks,
Daniel

Dear Daniel,
Good to hear from you. Happy Monday!

Unfortunately, we have not had a chance to do a complete review of things as of yet as we have some pressing matters. However, it would be helpful at this time if you could provide the interior dimensions of the glass cases for our review process. We are particularly interested in depth measurement. In addition, it would be helpful if you can verify that all of the glass cases have a power outlet.

Also when you say, ""We think we have an option that would allow us to directly contract with you to loan us some materials. Are you saying we would not need to submit a formal project plan for review?"

The studio is in Encinitas. We might be able to meet at the studio at some point depending on the timing. I am in the middle of something in the studio that should not be disturbed. I’m wondering if maybe an initial zoom call would be preferred. This way we get an overview and recap of where Ceci Moss is at and potentially ascertain what resources from the Trust UCSD would be seeking. Then based on that, I believe a studio visit would be more productive. 
These are my thoughts,

Thank Thomas. To answer your questions, this is why I would like to bring Ceci Moss into the conversation. They were working on something up through last year that I don't fully understand as I only joined the advisory committee this year. I just know we had to withdraw for some reason.

We do have some deep archive divers around here and some fantastic things have been dredged up, but that has not included my involvement. But I can certainly imagine an initiative related to an exhibition! I will help in my capacity in every way I can.

 I am also keen to be involved and to get my ICAM students involved, in fact I was added to the advisory committee specifically because I have an ongoing agenda to get undergrads involved in such things. Btw, I am Teaching Professor, a position with particular focus on undergraduate education, and I have organized special studies classes in the past to specifically perform new media archeology. That is a way I can contribute, possibly.

I really think us being in conversation including the MAG director who was involved in the abandoned effort, getting her into this loop would be great. Can we invite you both to campus, or possibly come to where you are? (Nina and I are both backcountry SD people, as it turns out. This was a serendipitous connection indeed!)

cheers,
 Brett

 Dear Brett Stalbaum, 
 Thank-you for your interest in Harold Cohen’s work and for your introduction. I recall working with Sheldon Brown on the 2017 UCSD show ""Creating Computational Creativity.” I was also worked on Harold’s 2011 show ""Collaborations with my other self.”  And it was during the prep for the show I met Sheldon for the first time. 
 It seems you have already done some planning. I have a couple initial questions. Do you have a time frame for the show? With respect to creating a special exhibition while getting some art history grads involved, has there been any discussion on how that would shape the exhibition content? In other words, are you considering a historical dive? 
 I am currently working on resolving multiple Harold Cohen mysteries. One of these mysteries has to do with his 1976 mural titled “Drawing for Machine and Four Hands” executed at UCSD — a very early AARON work in a public space. Unfortunately, I unable to find any photos in our archive of the completed work — only a few cropped segments. Does this work still exist on campus? Who would I contact at UCSD regarding any possible historical photos of this work?  
 Also in our archives are mentions of Faculty shows but very little info on the works shown. There was a mention of a 1968 Fall show for example. This would have been just weeks after arriving to the campus. What was shown at that time? There are many other UCSD shows he participated in as well. Also in our archives is a mention of a 1995 Machine Painting being on loan to the UCSD Chancellor’s office (TCM#38). Is that still there?  
 I mention these because I am wondering if the direction you are pursuing is to highlight Harold’s direct contributions to UCSD. Harold built multiple drawing machines and painting machines and the turtle with much grow and development happened on the campus over time. And while AARON may have come to life at Stanford, it seems our oldest screen captures of AARON works are when Harold was here in San Diego and connecting to the Stanford computer via telephone line thereby running AARON remotely. This was 1975. And of course there are multiple high end computers he used on campus and helped acquire. That is another mystery... what happened to the various computer equipment. We have photos and video of these older systems using open reel tapes and removable hard drives. What happened to media? Do they still exist somewhere and if so, is there any code on any of the media or in printed form? Speaking of video and photos what additional media does UCSD have? Are you thinking in this direction? Or something else especially with respect to involving the art history grad.

 Regarding a potential zoom meeting, can you provide some potential times, dates and expected length of time. If we were to pull the Director of The Harold Cohen Trust — Paul Cohen — we need to keep in mind he is on the east coast.  
 Looking forward to hearing more. And hope at some point some of my questions can be answered."

I'm not sure how precise they need to be. Some of the measurements on

I am will be updating the spreadsheet later today.

I color coded each entry based on the result of trying to run each version. At the end of the document is the summary of each. I have only tested 111 versions. These are dated from 2007 to 2016. I have actually tried running earlier versions but they don't run not because of the code per se but rather due to compiler issues I have yet to resolve. 

Red shades = Does not run, 
Green shades = Exhibition VersionOrange shades = test version or debug version 
Yellow shades = WIP, developmental version or experimental version
Purple shades = This version produces AARON Files for printing 
Blue = 3-D hanging sculpture versions
White = did not know how to categorize these versions

Details
Red = Does not run    This is a rather obvious category 

Green shades - Exhibition Version    These versions do not produce files for printing they simply run unattended continuously making art on the screen and were intended to run at exhibitions. 
    Light Green = identified which exhibition this version ran at    Dark Green = runs like an exhibition version but unlikely that this particular one actually ran publically
Orange shades = Test or debug version    Seems that sometime Harold made versions to perform some kind of test to try something out possibly. And in other cases he has versions that have seem like he had some coding problems an maybe used these to figure out those problems. These are labelled debug.

Yellow shades = WIP, Intermediate, Development, Experimental
    These versions were never printed. They run but they seem like Harold was in the process of developing code. In some cases when it runs, it produces artwork files but the results are clearly not intended to have been printed or considered and official AARON artwork. Experimental are versions that seem like Harold was focusing on a particular aspect of AARON and therefore doesn't necessarily produce a full AARON image. 

Purple shades = This version produces AARON Files for printing 
      These versions most likely produced the files that were used to make the various AARON prints and paintings. 

Blue = generates 3-D hanging sculptures

White = did not know how to categorize these versions"

Sorry it took so long to scan the printed code pages. To give a background. I met Harold in August 1981 through his studio assistant Jeff Greenberg. Harold generously gave me access to his computer and studio and I was in the studio from around September 1981 to possibly 1984 but in-between in 1982 desktop computers appeared so by 1984 I had access to desktop computing. I learned C language and Berkeley Unix on Harold’s system. I am not sure but I may have been the only artist who was given access. In the studio there were multiple terminals and I was assigned to one. Harold had his, and Jeff had his. During this period, I was visiting faculty in the art / photography program at Cal Arts, and at some point Becky arranged to have me teach a photography course at MiraCosta College. (thank you Becky)

So I learned C and Unix starting in the fall of 1981 and throughout 1982. It took me a while to figure out how to create an artwork on the system (PDP-11 with vector drawn data sent to a Tecktronix 4014). The printout has a date of June 17, 1982 but I must have completed the visualization somewhat earlier. So interestingly this printout is the only remaining documentation of this visual project of mine. 

I came across a visualization opportunity reading an article in Scientific American about thermodynamic diffusion of perfume molecular particles which when released from a perfume bottle (limited concentration) eventually are evenlly distributed in the next large surrounding space. Surprisingly I was fortunate to pick this topic as its the basis for how generative AI image synthesis are modelled on today. My animation visualization is the only one I wrote on Harold’s computer, and it took some time. As I was learning C, Jeff gave me so technical guidance.

The attached code can be of interest to Harold’s legacy as it documents the interface between writing the code on the PDP-11 and how it is then visualized on the Tektronics vector-base green phosfor screen. I have included some of my own code, but left out a number of pages to reduce the clutter. Here is a description of the some of the pages:"

I am not sure I understand the question correctly. So, just to be clear, of the three shows you mention, there are “no"" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows. 

If we are referring to canvas works, there were 3 executed after these shows. One is now at the Tate. One is with Thoma. And we sent you the 3rd one. We have a 4th canvas work that is black lines only in the studio – no coloring. I did a detailed investigation for Valentina Ravaglia of the Tate into their work (RA26) for their Electric Dreams which you can view here if interested. 

RA26 (Oct 1979) - A Deeper Look

Shortly after I began working for Harold, he had me destroy a canvas work which may have been from that same period. But I really don’t know. It might have been more recent. 

We have a tiny collection of early non-canvas works. These are folded cloth works. Some are multi-panel-mural works, others a single panel. I hope to get to document them this year. The time period range of these works is not known but I rather think they are late 1970s early 1980s. 

If there are additional works out there, I am not aware of them. When I looked into the details and origins of the Tate’s RA26, I did not come across any information suggesting more than the known 4 canvas works were executed in the 1977-1979 style of AARON. 

Hope that helps, if you need anything else let me know,

Tom

 Hi Tom and Paul, 
I hope you are both doing well? 
Aside from the Tate, do you know how many of the large Turtle paintings are in museum or public collections? Shows at that time include Documenta 6, group show (1977), Stedejilk, solo show (1977) and SFMoMA, solo (1979). 
Really appreciate your help, as always!

Many thanks for getting back to me.

Apologies for any confusion. My question was: do you know if there are any
of the large 'Turtle' paintings, aside from the Tate, in public/museum
collections? I was wondering if any of the museum shows where he produced
those works (image attached, SFMoMA 1979, for example) had kept them in
their permanent collection. But if, as you say 'there are “no"" known works
that exist– at all – that were composed and executed at any of these
shows'. Then that's the answer. I'm curious what happened to them, but I
guess they were destroyed and not acquired by the Museums at the time?

Thanks for sending over such a detailed document of the work in the Tate
collection too. I really appreciate the in-depth research.

Thanks again,

George

I came across a video you might be interested in viewing dated December 1980. And while it is not the Holy Grail video of the Turtle in action, it does bring us a half step closer to seeing the elusive Turtle crawling. This video does have a recorded-live segment of AARON generating a Turtle Era work on the computer terminal. Also, I recently read an old correspondence written by Becky Cohen. In the letter she claims that the they had received a video tape of the 1977 Stedelijk Museum show. But unfortunately they could not find a machine that could play the tape. Apparently at that time the US had a different video format than what was being used in the Netherlands. She latter claimed in the letter that she was returning the video. I believe she was returning it in the hopes the video could be converted in the Netherlands for viewing in the US. I haven’t found a reply so I don’t know if a viewable video was returned. However, this does tell me that I video was made so there is still hope!
Here is the youtube link to the video of AARON running back in 1980. He also speaks of the Murals he was executing at the time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcnZegsQjYA

Have a great week,Tom"

We generated thousands of drawings and converted them to gcode for the
show. The are like 20gigs of drawings. The gcode isn’t easy to peruse, but
if you organize them from big to small then you can find all the plants
because they are much bigger files. When you visit, I can give you a usb
stick with all of them.

I’ve been running KCAT in my office for about a year and a half now on a
windows xp machine and if you take a pic of the drawing I can tell you if
I’ve seen anything like that.

In other news, I’ve got a magazine about Machine Arts coming out in about a
month and it has an article about the Harold Cohen Aaron show. Send me your
address and I’ll send you some for you and the trust. Also finally getting
around to having an editor look at the footage we shot of the show and
interviews we did with Christiane and Paul and you are missing from it,
once we start to see a story and start to pull a storyline together, I
reach out and we can record something on zoom.

Thanks for the update on your travels and future events for the
Whitney exhibit. It would be exciting to see it travel.

Zach is thriving at Bantam. He loves working there. He's like a kid in a
large candy store! Even has a new girlfriend (from NY city) and it looks
like it's fairly serious. We recently visited Peekskill and had the
opportunity to meet her. We were impressed!

As regards the hurricanes, the last one, Milton's center eye, came directly
at us. Lots of damage especially to our barrier islands. We survived in
our 9th floor condo (located in downtown Sarasota on Sarasota Bay) and were
especially lucky in that we never lost power, internet etc although all the
other condos in our neighborhood did. It's been almost two months and the
city is still trying to recover.

Congrats on your daughter's marriage! We did meet her at the reception
dinner but only for a few minutes. Sounds like she is smart like her Dad
and just as charming.

Boston is a great city. Did you know that there are several universities in
that area that would love to hire a prof with your bio!

Lastly, we'd love to have some of the Whitney drawings. If possible, how
about 10 from each of the plotters (total 20) and one from each plotter
(total 2) signed by the three famous Harold Cohen supporters. Of course,
please send the shipping costs and where I should send payment.

Our address:

401 S. Palm Ave., Unit 903

As for wording maybe something likeAs with all of Harold Cohen's AARON works each is unique. Here we offer a signed edition.

Sometimes you get lucky. I am looking at Harold's digital files from 
Quickbooks that go back to Jan 1988. Unfortunately, we don't have 
Quickbooks to open it properly. But, using a text editor I believe I 
found the entry we are looking for.

900125__o>h_ch_ich_10000.00_gordon bell_ptg ""on gauguin's beach""_

The way I read the entry is that he sold the ptg (painting) to Gordon 
Bell and received a check for $10,000. The entry of the date is 
1/25/1990 and the amount is close to what Paul recalled.

In quick books a few days earlier I see these additional entries that 
seem to be related to the delivery,
900108__mcc>o_mc_tra_46.76_harris ranch_lunch, taking ptg to Bells. corp 
to repay_
900107__mch>o_mc_tra_24.51_harris ranch_lunch, bell delivery_
900108__mch>o_mc_tra_19.79_harris ranch_lunch, bell delivery_

I feel confident that we could generate a bill of sale for you based on 
this historical information. I will, however, also now look into the 
hard files for further confirmation.

 Hi All,If we do decide to participate, I’d be happy to support. Too bad it is such short notice. I am not sure how any of this fits into the longer term goals. I believe Bre still has AARON files in reserve that were not plotted at the Whitney. That and/or Paul’s Maze reconstruction running on Bre’s plotter would certainly have the potential to still the show. 
If we want to piggyback and highlight the efforts you are currently doing (Gazelli) or plan to preview in the near future, maybe we have similar work here in the studio that is ready to hang and that is not part of the shipment to Gazelli.

 Hi Tom, 
Following your notes, they got inspired and  suggested to include a revised caption as per below:  
Computer-generated drawing (1976-1978) by Harold Cohen, University of California, San Diego. The drawing was probably made with the help of his artificial intelligence AARON that was published first in 1979.
If this won’t work, then they will include the original plus the date: Computer-generated drawing (1976-1978) by Harold Cohen, University of California, San Diego.
I believe the original plus the date works better but let me know what you think!

Hi Tom, 
This is all super useful - thank you! I have passed it on. I have relayed to them, that if they need to feature the date, it would be best to include 1976-1978.

 Mila,I was not able to determine the year. The particular style is from 1976 to 1980/82ish. With the production date more likely closer to 1976 than 1982. The fact that the original caption does not include AARON suggests it is certainly much closer to 1976. Harold didn’t mention AARON publicly until 1979 in his paper What is an Image? Some of the motifs suggest the work was produced during the Documenta show 1977 or prior to.  If you have to put a date I suggest circa 1976-1978. 
Let me know what you think,Tom

﻿ Hi Mila,I found quite a bit of information in our archives related to Herbert W Franke all of which can be viewed herehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14_kJAIaaMPWWQzCWQ3BJ09d452HCPYzu?usp=share_link
The most important find is a copy of Franke’s book with Harold’s images on page 120 along with the original caption — see attached. Instead of changing the caption, let’s go with the original since we have to assume Harold was okay with the original at that time as I found no objections in subsequent exchanges between Franke and Harold. -Tom

 Hi Tom!
Hope all is well.
Unfortunately they don’t have much more information on the works:There are 2 works, but they could belong in a set.They are sure these are real plots that are fixed on a carton. 
They said Harold’s image is published in the 1985 Springer edition page 120 (attached) 
They can use the published image with the same caption adding ~1983 or ~1984. 
They’ll need a response by end of tomorrow (29th) to make their publishing deadline.

Hi MilaThanks for the quick reply. Do you know if these were two distinct images and not intended to be one work? Also it sounds like you are saying they still have the original art works Harold sent. Do you believe that is true? If so I wonder is there is anything written on the back. Tom"

 Tom, which works are they? P


Hi Paul,As you know we have a shipment to Gazelli in process. Before the works go, I took the opportunity to ask Erin (Harold’s previous assistant) about 3 works that are significantly different than the other portraits style works. Prior to reaching out to her, I dug into the matter and based on what I found I put the dates at 2001 for all 3. All the other works are 1991 to 1998. After contacting Erin, she was able to verify that one of the works was generated in 2001 and thus adding credence to my findings. She wasn’t sure about the other two. She did however make the following comment, “I did not paint them. Nor did I see Harold paint them.” I have found digital files with similar imagery. I am not sure what we do about sending or not sending these as they may not actually be Harold Cohen works.

The code which I will scan this week-end and send to you is simple - it visualizes how a set of particles leave the contained space of a bottle to fill the large space around it. What is relevant to you is that I am using Harold’s environment of how the software data is visualized on the Tecktronix, so you get to have the code for the interface. 

—

Background: I arrived in San Digeo in August 1981, and was staying by chance with a grad student, Jeff Greenberg, who turned out to be Harold’s assistant. I saw a “BYTE” magazine in the corner of the room, and told him about my interest in getting to know about computers. Jeff took me to Harold’s studio and introduced me. It was a Friday afternoon. After about 5 minutes’ conversation, Harold said, come by Monday and we will get you a key to the studio. Harold knew I was an artist as I think Jeff had shown Harold my two-page photographic spread titled “Artificial Intelligence” in Parachute magazine, an art theory journal from Montreal.

I had access to Harold’s studio and equipment for about 3 years, while teaching photography at Cal Arts. That is how I learned computing, working at his PD-11 and later VAX mainframe whenever I was not in the way. There were 3 or 4 terminals so we each had our personal station. I got Kernigan’s and Ritchie’s book on C language and learned on my own with Jeff helping me out here and there. Harold never asked anything from me, and I consider his generous offer to his computer invaluable as there was no access to computers unless one was afiliated with academia, industry or the military. It was on Harold’s system that I was able to transition from the analog world of photography to the computational world. Nonetheless I had to wait until 1986 to be able to do “digital photography” when the AT&T Targa Truevision system became available. There is an early image from that series in the “Digital Witness” exh. at LACMA.

I was able to figure out the color code scheme Harold used for most of his 2001 aa file (aa=aaron file formatted files). There are 94 of them. About 1/2 dozen are different in some way so they are not yet translated. Also not yet attempt to translate are files listed as dd. There are 64 dd files from 2001.

Just to also reiterate what we discussed with Paul when he was in London -
it would be easier for us to carry out the appropriate condition checks on
all these works, and inventorise them when we receive them at the gallery
so the works that are slightly damaged and/or in need of tlc, we’ll sort it
out.

Looking forward to receiving these and thanks so much for all your help.

Thanks for all the thought you are putting into this.

A few short answers as we continue to collaborate:

 1.
You are right. We are prepared to offer our resources and support finding the best way to display items, as long as it proves reasonable and financially possible for us. So you are aware, any display supports we provide would have to remain the property of the airport after the exhibition.
 2.
I think a secure WiFi connection could prove a bigger lift than may be possible on the timeframe we are looking at. For that reason, if we chose to showcase the Maze program, perhaps something that is prerecorded would be easiest and most comfortable for the airport. That said, perhaps there is a way to still offer a QR code or live link to the program in action that travelers could take with them, if we moved forward that direction.
 3.
Regarding purchasingdue to FAA restrictions, we are not operating our displays as ""concession spaces,"" which renders us unable to ""sell"" the artwork at the airport. We could explore potentially placing some artwork in the concessions, or, our standard is that we provide the artist contact information/Instagram information. While we do not list the artwork for sale, the artist is able to make their own determination on how to handle the work after the loan agreement with the airport comes to an end.

At this point, I do think a studio visit to further identify specifics, and if there is suitable material for display, that would allow us to begin a proposal and sole source process. Would you be open to that? Would you have time available in the next few weeks? I think this would move us along the most quickly.

Thanks,
Daniel

Hi Daniel
Happy Tuesday, I am looking at the possibility of showcasing some of Harolds earliest computer works as our main focus. These early works were executed here in San Diego in the late 1960s early 1970s. Im thinking this would be a good way to introduce the passengers to the fact that some of the earliest computer composed art was done right here in San Diego as it was here where Harold began to utilize the computer to further develop himself and his art.

So with respect to my question hang-ready, I was referring to some of these older works. Some of these older works are on Calcomp plotter paper which are very light and flimsy. They are not behind a matte and not in a frame. They are basically loose and in some cases long strips of multiple images. We do have one older canvas work that is stretched but all the other canvas works from that time are rolled up and not stretched. We also have film negatives that are photos of works generated on the screen. These could be scanned and put in a slide show but I would like to have a couple original film strips on display. This would require backlighting of some sort. So basically, I was asking how about the division of effort. What effort do we need to do vs what you are able to do to have the works presented properly. If I understand you correctly, you do have some resources to assist us and that we dont necessarily need to have everything ready to go.

With respect to the computer/monitor behind glass, thanks for sharing the sound situation there. As part of the earliest-computer-works theme, and as an alternative to plotting works on paper, I was considering running our early 1970s reconstructed Maze program and generating works to a screen. Typically we would run this live, thus, generating works never before seen. However, because there would be no one there monitoring the computer in case of a computer crash, I am looking at generating the works prior to the show, recording them in advance and basically playing them back like a video. Not sure the Trust would be ok with that because we almost always do live generated work. Therefore, I am wondering if it were possible for us to monitor a live display remotely and/or generate the works remotely and then basically feed them via internet to the machine there at the airport? If we go with the case of a live feed of the reconstructed Maze program, we might provide a QR Code so the passengers can follow along on their phone.

Also, I am considering sharing some of the early correspondences, notebook sketches and possibly photos of additional works or artifacts from that time. These could be either on display there or made into slide a presentation or a mix of both.

One last comment or more like a question, if a passenger happened to want to purchase a Maze work onsite at the airport, is that a possibility?"

Dear Micheal,This is Tom Machnik of the Harold Cohen Trust. Back in 2016 and 2017 you did an appraisal of our inventory after Harold Cohen’s passing. We have a request from an individual who has one of Harold Cohen’s paintings. He is planning to move the painting from California to Colorado and is seeking an appraisal of the work in order to insure it properly for transport. Is this something you could do for him? If not, do you have a recommendation of someone who could a proper appraisal?"

Happy to coordinate for someone to be there when you're ready to send and
also can pass the cost of getting the work over to Rob's onto the client.

I understand it's not framed and would be useful to know the edition number
of the one you have over there if possible?

THANK YOU.

internal numbers. As you know, a single ""system"" in a maze drawing is a
tree rooted at 0, which means that the number along a line leading from 0
should be strictly increasing but not necessarily consecutive because on
each tree-growing iteration the number grows and if the ith iteration
doesn't find space to grow then the i+1 iteration might. I would have to
examine the drawings very closely to see whether this is the case, as the
numbers are very large and, thanks to the freehand line algorithm, the
connections between branches are obscure.

apparently a student of Harold’s, Mukayama?? The audio is muffled and I
can’t make out the name exactly. I know my mom remembers this lecture so I
can ask her. Mima also thanked Mr. Ito (again, not super sure), who is the
president of the art department, as well as the Committee of International
Relations (?) for inviting and helping fund the special lecture. The theme
of the lecture was “somthing something…Imagination in Art” or something
like that? I can’t make out the first part. I didn’t listen to the whole
lecture, but it sounds great! The part in second video at about 48 min in
during the Q &A is so interesting!

Can I share the video with my mom to see if she remembers anything else
pertinent?

Christie's - Pegah Hoghoughi <pegah@gazelliarthouse.com> - 2025-01-28 1219.eml,Christie's,Pegah Hoghoughi <pegah@gazelliarthouse.com>,zipnpup <zipnpup@yahoo.com>,Paul Cohen <paulrcohen@gmail.com>,2025-01-28 17:19:37,"Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:19:37 +0000",<CAPjN7k+fQjcGZ_4n2UNiO0HszdvxH5OBSk8EFXOxaEU32s3Ydw@mail.gmail.com>,"Hi Tom and Paul,

I hope this message finds you both well.

As you may know, I'm finalising the description for the upcoming Christie's
auction, which will appear on the auction page and the certificate of
authenticity. Could you please confirm whether this work is part of the
*Jungle* series or the *Eden* series?

I’d greatly appreciate your confirmation by the end of the day tomorrow, as
that’s my cataloguing deadline.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Created in 1987, Untitled (i23-3758) is a key example from Harold Cohen's
pivotal Drawing Machine era of works, and forms part of the celebrated Jungle
or Eden Series. By the late 1980’s AARON entered its fourth phase where
human figures were built upon a three-dimensional knowledge base of the
program. This series marked an important evolution in Cohen's practice,
generating complex compositions of human figures with foliage motifs that
had appeared in his work since the early 1980s. Using AARON, his
groundbreaking autonomous art-making program, Cohen algorithmically
prompted the generation of forms in a sophisticated space, resulting in
dramatically positioned figures stepping out of a complex jungle
environment. The plants are generated from a number of sophisticated rules
about morphology in terms of branching level, clustering patterns in leaf
formations, and plant size. The energy and rhythm of the composition
demonstrate Cohen’s continued exploration of how AI could emulate and
innovate artistic expression. [image: Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 17.17.34.png]

supervise a class project for three undergrads here at Pitt. The class is
a web development thing where they have to design a web front end and back

them a csv file that contains a fraction of Harold's stuff on Art Logic.
To get a grade in the class, they need the work to be evaluated by
professionals in the field. It would require you to sit through a short
demo and (probably) write a very short evaluation, just a few sentences.

My name is Neil Mendoza, I'm an artist working with technology. I saw you
teach at Pitt. Coincidentally, I actually have a few pieces installed at
the Children's Museum there including a drawing machine.

I'm helping a friend curate a show for Ctrl Gallery, a new pop up in LA.
The show will open on February 15th for three weeks so it will be open
during Frieze week when a lot of the art world is in town. The show is
based around machine imagination and I think your father's work would be a
perfect fit if there is anything available. I was just in London and really
enjoyed seeing his work at Electric Dreams at the Tate modern!

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!

for a day or two.

We then batch converted the files to strip out the color and converted them
to gcode and rotated the portrait ones to fit in the machine. We made 5600
drawings. I think we made it through less than 2000 KCAT drawings.

I think we did something like 10k maze drawings but my memory is hazy
there.

For the direct control we built a process based on Paul’s work to generate
work every morning. This proved to be more complicated for the operators
and they ended up generating new drawings every morning but then running
drawings from a different folder thus drawing the same drawings everyday.
After that, we generated something like 10k mazes and I think we had
folders with dates on them.

There was some sorcery involved to have it be drawing on the screen and on
the machine at the same time.

The project that I would love to do with you would be a book of Harold
cohen KCAT plants. My favorite drawings are the ones with plants and second
favorite are the plants and people.

These files are easy to find because if you sort by file size the plants
are a lot bigger files.

Paul Rickards, who is an awesome artists went down a rabbit hole and
adapted the KCAT drawings to a cmyk approach. He processes the KCAT output
with python code. He gave me two of these as a gift. I’m not at the office
but can send you a pic later.

Hi Doug, thanks for your email. I hope you are keeping well. Perhaps we'll bump into each other around the Electric Dreams show? I plan to be there for a couple of days.

Thanks for your eagle eye on these prints. The whole experience has been interesting and edifying. Harold didn't keep the best records, so Tom Machnik, Harold's studio manager, cc'd here, labored long to track down editions and provenance. Your notes on the above are super helpful, thank you!

Looking forward to seeing you in late November if you are around."

Interesting!

You mentioned that you ""might have the mural panels in the studio or we
might not..."" I appreciate that would be a big, inconvenient undertaking,
so there is no need to do anything about that. But just so I'm clear: these
are mural panels made of wood, hand painted by Harold, and not made by the
Turtle at all? And the only large scale drawings made by the Turtle were on
paper? Sorry I keep coming back to this, but I just want to understand.
There are only three examples of the large scale drawings on canvas (like
the one we have), but they were also painted by Harold from B+W negatives
projected, not made by the Turtle either?

Looking forward to hearing from you,

I think the panorama large plotter would work. I am confident that we could
come up with a solution to put it on the wall.

I think unattended won’t work. I can’t expect a mass produced 2d printer to

The photoshoot went well with the photographer Pablo Mason. Because the works are behind plexiglass it was a bit of a challenge to get the lighting right. Fortunately had plenty of black draping fabric to setup around the studio to reduce the reflection. Once he got it right I saw the first photo and it looked fabulous. With the right lighting it looks even better than with the ambient light in the studio. It was a pleasure working with him. If we need someone in the future I would not hesitate to recommend him again. 

I am waiting for the final pickup time for the work but it is tentatively set for sometime this Wednesday.  The works are basically ready to go. I will check them one more time tomorrow. I am hoping to get the link to Pablo's photos tomorrow so I can put them into the shipment list document that needs to be signed upon pickup.

This has been a real push to make this happen. I haven't even had a moment to look at Roger's print. He showed it to me when I picked it up last Monday and the brief moment I saw it, I was happily surprise that it looked quite close to the original. I will need to really look at it closely though. Assuming all goes well and no more immediate concerns with Gazelli, I will look at the Roger's print this week. I will also pull a drawing for George Legrady finally. And see what can be done regarding work for the Whitney folk. 

I didn't keep track of my hours related to Sotheby. When I started I didn't think it would have ballooned into the time consuming activity that it did. In a previous email you mentioned this was a lesson learned and you we even considering pulling the plug at the very last minute. I agree with you that at time point it would do more harm than good to pull the plug at this late stage. Let's see how the auction goes. I sure hope it is a success. And I understand that part of the strategy is to sway the Tate into buying a software version possibly. If that happens, then certainly Sotheby is a success.

A while back in the summer we talked about various things. One of them was an increase in pay. I have added an increase on this invoice. The last time I had a raise was 2016. I calculated the inflation rate from 2016 to 2024 using https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2016?amount=1 which claims today $45.94 is the equivalent of $35 dollars in 2016. My new invoice rate is a bit higher at $50/hr. I hope this doesn't break the bank but I am doing much more and have much more responsibility than back in 2016. There are times I am basically working around the clock. I am not saying this as a complaint as I am committed to improving the legacy of Harold/AARON and would have left a long time ago if I didn't enjoy being involved. It does seem like an exciting time and I am hoping the trust continues to outperform our expectations. I hope our relationship with Mila remains solid and that Gazelli continues to be successful. I recently learned I am no longer eligible for health care from California due to COVID winding down. The health care was basically free. Next month, I will need to sign up for health care. Previously, you had mentioned about paying for my health care. I really don't know how much that will be yet but I hope the Trust will consider paying for my health care.

internal numbers. As you know, a single ""system"" in a maze drawing is a
tree rooted at 0, which means that the number along a line leading from 0
should be strictly increasing but not necessarily consecutive because on
each tree-growing iteration the number grows and if the ith iteration
doesn't find space to grow then the i+1 iteration might. I would have to
examine the drawings very closely to see whether this is the case, as the
numbers are very large and, thanks to the freehand line algorithm, the
connections between branches are obscure.

At Harold’s opening we had talked about tracking down some of Harold’s code from the early 1980s in my storage space. Also Becky who I had not seen for many decades, amazingly remembered I wrote my first program in Harold’s lab that visualized the operation of perfume molecules leaving an enclosed contained space into a wider open space as a way to illustrate that time cannot proceed backwards as the molecules could not be recollected and returned back into the enclosed space of the bottle. I got the story from a Scientific American article and this seemed at the time to be a good first coding project as a continuity to my staged studio photography. 

I had forgotten about this code until Becky mentioned it at the opening this past winter, but this week-end, I inadvertendly came across a full printout in a stored box. It is dated June 17, 1982, and takes up 20 pages. 

Even though I wrote the code that visualizes the molecular animation, nearly all of the utilities subroutines used to visualize the moving dots on the TeckTronix screen as seen here on the right page was written by Harold, so the full printout partially documents what part of his code was like at that time. Unfortunately, the more interesting aspect of Harold’s code I dont have, only the utilities subroutines. Additionally, the code also gives the insight of how to get the data from the PDP-11 to the Tecktronix to visualize the program.

Please let me know how you all want to access the code if it is of interest. I can scan all the pages and do a OCR to turn it into real code. Also how do we distribute the credit given that the subroutines are Harold’s whereas the molecular animation is mine. For the coding finetuning, I was asisted by Jeff Greenberg, who was Harold’s studio assistant at the time. 

Very Best, 

George"

Hi Paul
I have been in contact with Harold’s former assistant Nina Karavasiles. Her time with Harold was approximately 1989 to 1995. She has been helpful in filling in details from the transition from drawing to painting time period. Would it be ok for her to visit the studio next week. I would like to ask her some further questions regarding the works that will be sent to London before they go. Let me know if you think that would be ok for her to visit the studio,

Dear Ceci, Thomas, Paul, Nina and trust,

Just taking a moment here to make introductions between us all. Ceci 
Moss is my dear colleague and director of the Mandeville Art Gallery at 
UCSD where I serve as an advisory board member. Thomas is Art Studio 
Manager of the Harold Cohen Trust, Nina is a former student of Harold's, 
UCSD MFA and of course Paul is Harold's son and a computer scientist of 
many roles including dean at Pitt and DARPA alum. (Side note: Paul, we 
started this convesation with the fact that Harold has been part of our 
curriculum in AI arts history units in our vis 142 class since I started 
here in 2004, a class in which we also discuss DARPA! There are so many 
neat serendipitous connections here... Nina is a backcountry neighbor of 
mine and knows my wife Paula from Warner Springs, where Paula is the 
public school art teacher... they have worked together in the past:-)

So that conversation has been about UCSD's recent attempts and plans to 
honor Harold's legacy here. The idea that had emerged was that we meet 
up in person and discuss further. So I am just throwing out intros at 
this point, and looking for thoughts as to a time line for meeting!

cheers all,
Brett Stalbaum"

Well, we have a dilemma. I actual see two additional options. I don't necessarily have the final word as we should get Paul's input. In order of my preference from most preferred to least, I list them below. Just want to note that knowing what I now know, I would not have sent this one. 

Preference from most preferred to least1) Pull the work from the auction2) Sell the print but without the NFT or sell NFT without print
3) Use your 2nd option with a minor changeYour second option is to leave the certificate as is but add a note. I suggest changing the note on the certificate to, ""this is the earliest known file the estate has for this work.""  I would leave out, ""the descriptor file was not saved until 2003"". We might consider, ""the earliest known descriptor file for this work has a 2003 timestamp.""
4) is the one about changing the certificate to 2003. This is probably the most appropriate thing to do because it reflects reality. But we are concerned about the implications for the collectors. And because of this, I included the option of pulling the work from the auction or selling the print but not the NFT with it. 

Honestly, except for #1 I am a bit uncomfortable with all of them. Maybe in general an auction is not the proper venue for selling works that include signing errors. Maybe in those cases it would be better to have a one-on-one conversation with the collector on the reality and provide a more complete story of the work. And maybe this is what we should do regarding this work.

I do have an additional concern regarding this work (with respect to generating a certificate) in that we have some evidence that a 2/3 and 3/3 might have been made and as of yet, I do not know how they were signed. I do know that in our 2002 - 2004 catalog (the one I showed you when you visited)... in there the work is documented as being 2003. So again everything points to the work being 2003 and that Harold made an error. 

If we keep the claim of the print as being signed as 2002 without explanation, internally we will have implications as well. And these implications may actually out way the concern of the implications related to collectors. For example, if we want to make our 2002 - 2004 catalog in its current or expanded form more widely available, the catalog will not jive with the certificate. And in any other instance whereby Harold referred to this work (this includes multiple Powerpoint presentations, speeches and the like) the confusion is only exasperated due to that one number in pencil being written as a 2 and not a 3.
I know this is on the eve of the auction and I would have preferred I didn't send this one. And like you mention though not in these exact terms, this work belongs to the misfits group. I don't know we can pull this work on the eve of the auction but that is my preference. But I am open to hear what Paul things about all this.

 Thanks Tom for double checking all this.  Appreciate that all this takes time and it’s sometimes hard to determine what happened so long ago.
Regarding this work, we now have two options:
1) We create a new certificate for the print and change the date from 2002 to 2003.  The problem with this is that the collector would receive the print and may then ask why the year says 2002 whereas the record says 2003 and this may create further confusion and invite further scrutiny regarding dates written on other prints.  I think we would want to avoid this as we are looking to build a trusted market for this works.  We would also need to destroy the already minted NFT which states a production year of 2002 which is what is supplied although the file metadata does say 2003.
2) We leave the certificate for the print as it stands which states it was produced in 2002.  We add a note to the certificate for the NFT to say this is the earliest known file the estate has for this work and say that the descriptor file was not saved until 2003.  The benefit with this is we don't have to re-mint or re-issue the NFT or the certificate and we can simply amend the certificate for the NFT to reflect the above.
I suspect there may be other cases we come across when we put together the catalog raisonne and it may be better to include all works together in a series of changes the estate agrees upon than to introduce all this know on the eve, so to speak, of the selling exhibition with Sotheby’s.
We will do whatever you think is best but from our perspective we think Option 2 is preferable at this stage.
Grateful for your thoughts and guidance on this.

Please let me know what
you think:

Define a folio to be a collection of prints that have some coherence (e.g.,
AG1 - AG12)

Define a reference folio to be a folio that can be used as reference
material for reprinting or by scholars etc. Note that a reference folio
can contain damaged works provided the damage does not prevent the
reference material being used as intended. Note also that a reference
folio need not be signed.

As with individual works, we should *never* sell the reference folio.

That's the easy part. Now the harder part concerns selling work from
nonreference folios. Here we need guidance from Mila. I think we could
make the argument that we should not break up the last of a folio, unless
the prices warrant it or there is no prospect of selling the entire folio
as a unit. Suppose we have two copies of a folio (e.g., two undamaged
copies of each of the 12 prints in AG), then I would argue that we can sell
from one of these folios.

What do you think?"

Hope you're keeping well. I've just seen the Sotheby's catalogue for the Harold Cohen sale and thought I should get in touch.

 I see that they've now updated the online description for 0305-08, which was incorrect until recently. For information I acquired a copy of this for the museum in 2005, along with a copy of 0305-03 (no. 2 of 5 - not in the Sotheby's catalogue).

Several of the other works in the Sotheby's sale have appeared in print or online too, but I don't know whether copies of any of them were ever acquired by anyone.

Hi Doug, first I must apologize for a very close deadline. I just learned of this opportunity from the Schmidt Sciences<https://schmidtsciences.smapply.io/prog/humanities_and_artificial_intelligence_virtual_institute_havi_/> foundation. A few months ago I proposed to one of the LLM companies a “21st Century Catalogue Raisonne” built around Harold. That proposal looks like it will go forward, but slowly, so I am proposing the same to Schmidt, except I want to build something not just for Harold’s CR but for any artist who wants it. I am trying to assemble a consortium of experts on very short notice and I am hoping that I can tempt you to participate. Christiane Paul and Mila are on board, as are Bre Pettis and Tom Machnik. I’m trying to get in touch with Pip Laurensen but no luck so far.

The pre-proposal is due on Friday. It’s only three pages and is well in hand. I wouldn’t need anything from you until they accept the pre-proposal and give us 60 days to write the full proposal. I have attached the original proposal to the LLM company (please don’t share it) to give you a sense of what the Schmidt pre-proposal will say.

I do hope you can participate, I think this could be a really interesting project.

Thanks! —Paul



Hi Paul

Nice to hear from you, and I'm glad the information was useful. I imagine it's a nightmare tracking everything Harold produced.

I'll be away for a few days from 24-27 Nov but hopefully we might still be able to meet up!

Best wishes

Hi Doug, thanks for your email. I hope you are keeping well. Perhaps we'll bump into each other around the Electric Dreams show? I plan to be there for a couple of days.

Thanks for your eagle eye on these prints. The whole experience has been interesting and edifying. Harold didn't keep the best records, so Tom Machnik, Harold's studio manager, cc'd here, labored long to track down editions and provenance. Your notes on the above are super helpful, thank you!

Looking forward to seeing you in late November if you are around."

Hi George Thanks so much for the extra code. This plotting routine is very interesting. Helps to answer some questions. Do you recall whether or not the .h header files are your making or Harold’s.  I ask because it seems like some of the definitions and macros were made in such a way that the Harold’s older SAIL code or even Fortran could be used with out completely translate each line manually into c. Not sure this is true but just a thought based on observation.

Happy Thursday and happy June already! I hope you can help me with a question. From time to time I work on researching where Cohen’s works are. Harold left behind lists of museums and other entities but did not necessarily document what those works were. Also in the case of Robert Hendel and others who may have had the original an original work they then donate to a museum. Unless they notify us we are not aware of the transfer. Therefore, the list doesn’t necessarily help. 
I can (and do from time to time) contact various institutions. Some institutions have the ability to search on the website others do not. Are you aware of some sort of database for museums and/or other institutions that may have what I am looking for — name lists of Cohen works? Also, when I do contact a museum, when I don’t have a personal contact, I rarely make any headway. Do you have any suggestions on what department or what position I ask for? Or any other suggestions? I’d appreciate you thoughts.

prices Harold's work for sale through the gallery and could probably give

could recommend an appraiser.

One thing to keep in mind is that prices for Harold's work are rising,

My recollection of the pricing
discussion is similar to yours, but not quite the same, and my recollection
of our strategy might be a bit different as well.

I recall that the pricing discussion changed from ""size-based"" to
""quality-based"". Mila pointed out that some mid-sized works are better
than others. She asked why some should not be priced at X, where X is
higher than 150K. FWIW, I think the four mid-sized works cited in your
email aren't the best, so I won't argue that their price should be higher.
But if we were planning to show, say, 2475 or 2476 etc. then I'd agree with
Mila: These are better paintings.

As to strategy, we discussed several but I don't remember which we settled
on. At one point in the conversation, Mila suggested not sending large
works to the art fairs but holding them back. At another point we
discussed sending a mix of mid-size and large work. I think we all agreed
that small canvases are anomalous and will be held back. You seem to be
suggesting sending a mix of mid-sized and large works priced at 150K and
300K, respectively. Do you intend that the mid-sized works for the fairs
will be the ones you mention in your message, or were you suggesting only
that these works should be priced at 150K as our first tranche irrespective
of where they are shown for sale?

Changing subject, any further thoughts on us purchasing Tom Gruber's
paintings?

Incidentally, I got an alert from Artsy this morning. Is this just a

Michael Maloney appraised Harold's estate right after he died for tax
purposes so the appraisals were low and the recent increase in prices
wasn't reflected. It might be more accurate to ask the Gazelli Art House,
which represents the Harold Cohen Trust, for a reference for an appraiser."

The Open University programme with the course code M206/TV10 has the BBC programme number FOUM535A and is subtitled “Artware”, this was transmitted on 29 April 1997 (NB not 24 April).

The Tate Gallery item does appear to have been filmed in the Gallery itself, there is no indication on the BBC paperwork exactly when the filming took place but it is likely to have been on the day of transmission or very shortly before.

Kind regards

Dear Andrew,
Thank you for the list. I know it is not much but every little be helps. I am familiar with ""It'll Never Work"" as we have this programme on VHS tape. We also have a VHS tape of ""Knowledge Talks: The Turing Test"" but I did not have the date of the work so the date was very helpful. In regards to ""Open University: Artware..."" We have a tape with a printed label. Some of the text is difficult to read but it might read as:
A.LAW BBC OPEN UNIVERSITY ?OUM535A M206/TV10
This is a PAL format VHS and since we only have NTSC equipment I have yet to view it. There is a date of on the tape being 17/1/97. Based on this limited information, can you tell if this is the same programme as the Open University 24/04/97? If not, might you be able tell me what this programme is about?

In regards to the Newsnight 07/06/83 programme. This the first time to learn of this one. Cohen was in London around that time for a show at the Tate. Can you tell if the ""Item on Computer Art"" was filmed at the Tate Museum on our about the date of airing? In other words, is there a way to know where & when the filming took place?"

So nice to hear from you! It's been the dream of curators, museum staff, and the digital art world, in particular, to have an archive or meta-data interoperability to be able to trace an artist's work across institutional collections. Sadly, initiatives so far haven't gone anywhere, so we are all stuck with tracing works in individual collections. The registrar or staff in the registrar's department are typically the best people to contact.

When it comes to private collectors donating to institutions or reselling, the situation tends to be even worse. I think in this case the use of NFTs as certificate of authenticity could play a valuable role  at least the transfer of a work from one owner to another could be transparently traced.

I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
All the best,
Christiane

 Hi Robert,Well, we have a dilemma. I actual see two additional options. I don't necessarily have the final word as we should get Paul's input. In order of my preference from most preferred to least, I list them below. Just want to note that knowing what I now know, I would not have sent this one. Preference from most preferred to least1) Pull the work from the auction2) Sell the print but without the NFT or sell NFT without print3) Use your 2nd option with a minor changeYour second option is to leave the certificate as is but add a note. I suggest changing the note on the certificate to, ""this is the earliest known file the estate has for this work.""&nbsp; I would leave out, ""the descriptor file was not saved until 2003"". We might consider, ""the earliest known descriptor file for this work has a 2003 timestamp.""4) is the one about changing the certificate to 2003. This is probably the most appropriate thing to do because it reflects reality. But we are concerned about the implications for the collectors. And because of this, I included the option of pulling the work from the auction or selling the print but not the NFT with it. Honestly, except for #1 I am a bit uncomfortable with all of them. Maybe in general an auction is not the proper venue for selling works that include signing errors. Maybe in those cases it would be better to have a one-on-one conversation with the collector on the reality and provide a more complete story of the work. And maybe this is what we should do regarding this work.I do have an additional concern regarding this work (with respect to generating a certificate) in that we have some evidence that a 2/3 and 3/3 might have been made and as of yet, I do not know how they were signed. I do know that in our 2002 - 2004 catalog (the one I showed you when you visited)... in there the work is documented as being 2003. So again everything points to the work being 2003 and that Harold made an error. If we keep the claim of the print as being signed as 2002 without explanation, internally we will have implications as well. And these implications may actually out way the concern of the implications related to collectors. For example, if we want to make our 2002 - 2004 catalog in its current or expanded form more widely available, the catalog will not jive with the certificate. And in any other instance whereby Harold referred to this work (this includes multiple Powerpoint presentations, speeches and the like) the confusion is only exasperated due to that one number in pencil being written as a 2 and not a 3.I know this is on the eve of the auction and I would have preferred I didn't send this one. And like you mention though not in these exact terms, this work belongs to the misfits group. I don't know we can pull this work on the eve of the auction but that is my preference. But I am open to hear what Paul things about all this.Tom

 Thanks Tom for double checking all this. &nbsp;Appreciate that all this takes time and it’s sometimes hard to determine what happened so long ago.Regarding this work, we now have two options:1) We create a new certificate for the print and change the date from 2002 to 2003. &nbsp;The problem with this is that the collector would receive the print and may then ask why the year says 2002 whereas the record says 2003 and this may create further confusion and invite further scrutiny regarding dates written on other prints. &nbsp;I think we would want to avoid this as we are looking to build a trusted market for this works. &nbsp;We would also need to destroy the already minted NFT which states a production year of 2002 which is what is supplied although the file metadata does say 2003.2) We leave the certificate for the print as it stands which states it was produced in 2002. &nbsp;We add a note to the certificate for the NFT to say this is the earliest known file the estate has for this work and say that the descriptor file was not saved until 2003. &nbsp;The benefit with this is we don't have to re-mint or re-issue the NFT or the certificate and we can simply amend the certificate for the NFT to reflect the above.I suspect there may be other cases we come across when we put together the catalog raisonne and it may be better to include all works together in a series of changes the estate agrees upon than to introduce all this know on the eve, so to speak, of the selling exhibition with Sotheby’s.We will do whatever you think is best but from our perspective we think Option 2 is preferable at this stage.Grateful for your thoughts and guidance on this.BestRobert

Sharing with you the material for final sign off!
(Please note this is being reviewed by Sotheby's too so there might be some
tweaks made to it)

Their main concern was the uniqueness of the work. It has to be identified
as unique, despite the physical print saying otherwise. The way around
this, we suggest the wording that is found both in the press release (at
the bottom) and the description of the NFT: ""Unique, signed edition and the
only known one that has been produced during the artist's lifetime.""
Are you happy with this?

“The Harold Cohen Trust notes that the artist has signed this print as 2002 but has concluded this was an error. The file name 0311-32 refers to the year 2003, the month November and the 32nd Aaron generated work in that month.'

We will also need to burn the existing NFT and re-mint it with the correct date. Please let me know if this works and I’ll inform Sotheby’s.

Canvas shipping list - George Lionel Barker <george@gazelliarthouse.com> - 2024-12-03 0602.eml,Canvas shipping list,George Lionel Barker <george@gazelliarthouse.com>,"Mila Askarova <m.askarova@gazelliarthouse.com>, Paul Cohen <paulrcohen@gmail.com>",,2024-12-03 11:02:37,"Tue, 3 Dec 2024 11:02:37 +0000",<CAFoqNjQgFL9Q5SqqaYLe9qcRDLxi9uEh130FzQ-UK6xUTV-gNA@mail.gmail.com>,"Dear both,

Please find enclosed a link to our proposed shipping list for the
figurative canvases that are currently in Encinitas, to be sent alongside
the unrolled works in Tom's previous email:
https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/f5fcb1f56f9ce5a013b84a/

Can we please also have the remaining Painting Machine works you have there
too? New pricing TBC.

We agreed to set the retail price of HC2477, HC2448, HC4426 and HC4427 at
£150,000. I think it would be beneficial to sell one work in the new year,
leaving three for the fairs.

The plan was to market some of them at Dallas Art Fair and Armoury NYC in
2025, alongside a selection of other Cohen works. At this stage, we would
still need to be invited/apply to both fairs, and the longer term goal is
Frieze and Basel in 2026.

Are we ok to price the first available large one at £300,000? And then
increase the price by 100k until the third one is £500,000? It looks like
there are 15 or so large ones, compared with 10 medium sized ones.

Regarding a cursory stock-check of all figurative canvases, both in London
and California, I have counted 29 in total. There are 4 not listed on AL,
but found via a PDF on our shared drive (attached). We are hoping that
Tom's rolled canvases yield some more.

I think we'd need to get the shipping process up and running as soon as we
can.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

George

Not sure what to do about this email from NBC or future emails like this.
Previous to us having the haroldcohentrust account, media requests would
have gone to GAH first. I am now in the habit of checking this email weekly

They were or may still be looking for an interview with respect to this
month’s Christie’s AI Auction. The email may be a form type letter as it
sounds like they don’t know Harold has passed. I know there is controversy
surrounding some of the works at auction. Especially programs scanning

 Hey Tom, 
Thanks so much for getting back to me, I appreciate it. 
Is the good friend of Harold you spoke to interested in selling? It's important for us to try and avoid the risk of Cohen's work appearing in public auction, and we'd be delighted to have a conversation with them about a possible sale. Either way, it's great that you've had the chance to look through the inventory, and discovered one of the panels from 'The Age of Intelligent Machines'! 
It has been a real pleasure working with you all over the past few years. It's been a personal point of pride to have been involved in helping expand the audience for Harold's work.

 Hi George,Good to hear from you. Sorry about the delay. Yesterday, I was at a good friend of Harold’s yesterday doing inventory of their collection of Cohen/AARON works which turns out the collection spans the time period from 1971 to 2012. The 1971 work is one of the original LACMA Maze drawings that were executed and mail out as invitations to the 1972 show. Another important discovery is that they have one of the panels from an important piece titled “The Age of Intelligent Machines (1986).” We have two of the panels in the studio but I have long wondered why one was missing. Now I know where that is! 
In any case, you are interested in more recent works. The only information I have of 1991-1999 works being in collections is for Robert Hendel and Frank Dictrich. You are right ""Stephanie and Friend” is with Whitney now but originally was with Robert Hendel’s collection. In addition to Stephanie and Friend, Hendel has or had multiple works from this time period. My understanding is that he was ok with the Whitney taking the other Cohen/AARON works in his collection but the Whitney does not accept entire private collections or something to that effect. So it is possible that additional works from this time period in his collection were sent to other museums.  Dictrich seems to have had only one work a 1997 piece and I don’t have any info on who he is yet. I don’t see any museums listed. I will look some more today but want to get this to you sooner than later,
I understand, your last official day is tomorrow. Feel free to keep in touch beyond that time. I wish you much luck in your future and look forward to the time with our paths will cross again.

I've got what will hopefully be a quick question. Do you know which museums have AARON/Cohen's figurative works on canvas in their collection? Similar series and period as this one in the Whitney collection (Stephanie and Friends) https://whitney.org/collection/works/67981

I am still
bouncing back and forth between Pittsburgh and Boston, and we just listed
the house in Pittsburgh and are renovating the one in Boston. This is my
16th or 17th house but the work gets harder as I get older!

Anyway, half my stuff is here and the other half there, and it's always the
wrong half. The Whitney drawings that I promised you are in Pittsburgh and
I am in Boston until the end of the month, but I will send them as soon as
I get back.

In other news...Mila Askarova and I are trying to get the exhibition to
Asia, and I have a ""sort of promise"" from an LLM company to provide some
sponsorship, so we're hopeful. It has been pretty rough since January, as
you can imagine, and now everything is tinged with fear and considerations
that have nothing to do with art. Other things: We tried a NFT sale
through Sotheby's but it was not successful. Sotheby's couldn't make their
minds up: Initially it was to be a NFT experiment, but then they
emphasized the physical works rather than the digital versions, and
eventually it became a sale of prints masquerading as an NFT drop. So
you'll be relieved to hear that NFTs are not in our immediate future!
Also, Gazelli has a really strong booth at the Dallas Art Fair and it's
already getting press
<https://www.papercitymag.com/arts/dallas-art-fair-year-17-what-to-collect/>
.

More recently I have been reimagining the catalog raisonne. I have
attached a short proposal to the Schmidt Foundation; I hope you find it
interesting. They probably won't fund it because their focus is on
humanities, but the modern catalog raisonne extends beyond the visual arts
and I hope they see that.

Lastly, I am sure I have asked you this before but my memory isn't what it
was: I think I need to set up an LLC to be owned by the Harold Cohen Trust
so that I can pay Tom and make distributions to the heirs without incurring
a personal tax burden, but I really need professional advice. The people
I've spoken with in Pittsburgh won't touch it because the Trust is
registered in California, so things are at a standstill, which is a
problem. Do you have any ideas about how to move forward?"

I was the director of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center from 2018-21 and the version of AARON I showed at there was Drifting World. It was a loan from the Carnegie Science Center (it's the permanent installation referenced in Harold's bio).

I would have said that it was Paul who pointed me to the Carnegie but that's probably wrong (?).

I took some photos which I will upload tomorrow. In general there are two different kind of spaces. One being flat walls — or nearly flat — and the other being big glass cases set into the wall space. The flat spaces could possibly accommodate projection but I am not quite sure because people would be walking by. Daniel seems to think it would be doable so maybe it is. The glass cases are approximately 8 ft high although one might be a bit shorter. The width varies with the biggest around 16 ft. There is one space that people would see as there are going through the TSA queue. This is one of the glass spaces. The remaining spaces are all on the other side after going through TSA. On the way toward the international terminal area is one of the flat wall spaces. Daniel was concerned about using this as a projection space because there tend to be ambient light and shadows on the space. It is quite a good size space though. We don’t have measurement but I suspect it is 20 ft long and the height 6-8ft. Continuing down the hallway into the terminal area there is a seating area with 3 walls surrounding the space. Each wall has glass cases. Electricity is available in each of the cases if necessary. Then down on the opposite side of the terminal there is another flat space and for the current show they had multiple canvas pieces. This space has a low ceiling compared to the others spaces. 
In additional to showing the spaces, Daniel talked about the stipend and because it is quite low he prepared me in advance. He said the stipend would $1,500. However, he said that they would handle all the shipping, handling logistics and insurance. He also said that normally there is a proposal submission process but that he would talk legal to try to get that waved. 
I also asked about timelines and basically whatever would be shown would be picked up sometime in December. And the decision on what would be shown has to be decided by August. 
We did talk about an active plotter. Based on what I saw, any plotter would have to be vertical. And with respect loading paper a roll or some other method would need to be implemented to minimize having to have a person interact with the plotter. I ask Daniel what he thought the maximum interaction with plotter would be. He thought that a maximum of once every two weeks. Although, if the staff at the airport were not involved, he seemed to think it could be more often. 
So that is kind of the summary. 
I am  putting on my thinking cap. At this time, I would prefer the glass cases. Unfortunately having a traditional projection in the cases would not be practical. However, I do see Samsung has interesting solution whereby the image is projected from the floor onto a rolled screen (see link below). Nice idea, but I rather think a more narrow system would be required for the airport cases. If we want to go that route of we’d need a solution that fits inside the case. I do think a mechanical machine would be more engaging. The projections are nice but with the nature of the world today with screens everywhere I wonder if another screen would just be another screen and would get lost. I know we don’t have much time, but I’m wondering if an unconventional solution can be found. A plotter that is more like a etch-a-sketch that doesn’t require paper.  Or one that plots on a white board that can then be erased or something similar. I’m also wondering how we might implement a way for people to have an image as a take-away. I know we don’t have much time, but what if we had an app that worked only in proximity of the display. And if they like the image being generated they could capture it on with the app in some way maybe. Thereby having their own NFT of sorts. An NFT that we would still have control over. 
We could just go with static pieces too. 
 If you want to talk more about it we can.

I was thinking of you both
last week because, yes, I went to England for the opening of Electric
Dreams and also to meet with Mila and her team at the Gazelli gallery. A
commercial sponsor might be interested in underwriting the touring of the
Whitney show. Very early stages of discussion, but they seem quite
excited. As it happened, Bre Pettis (the plotter guy) was also in London.
Is Zach still enjoying his work there?

Did you and the art survive the twin hurricanes? I think one of them hit
your part of Florida pretty hard, didn't it?

I can't remember whether you met my daughter and her fiancee at the Whitney
event. They got married last month, very lovely ceremony with a small
crowd of friends from college and their respective labs. Allegra is
finishing a tour or duty at DARPA and planning her next gig.

Last week I bought a house in Boston so I can be closer to Allegra and
Hitch. I was at the Courtauld Institute during the closing looking at the
Cezannes, but thanks to Docusign it all worked! I'll sell the Pittsburgh
place in the spring. No idea whether I'll remain as a prof. The Trust
takes so much time but it doesn't pay me anything, so I'm kinda stuck
between a rock and a hard place!

As to drawings, we have a ridiculously big stack of them in San Diego and
I'd be happy to send some (I'll need your address). I also have five from
each plotter that were signed by Christiane, Bre and me. I'll send one of
each of these if you're interested."

This is fantastic! Thanks for sharing the details on you perfume molecule visualizer. Sounds very interesting how you used Harold's subroutines as part of your animation. It would be nice to get this running again to how Harold's routines played a roll in your 1982 code and see if there is any hints of AARON running in the background in addition to seeing what your visualizer did. So cool.
 I will confer with Paul as to what would be best. My thoughts are... For our archives I would like the scanned 20 pages as a PDF but if it is not too much trouble having both the scan and OCR would be ideal. Knowing some of the names of Harold's routines might be valuable in connecting it to the notebooks we have and the oldest code we have.

I agree and have had lengthy conversations with Michael yesterday regarding
this as in all of our material we have always said that it was an editioned
work (as I mentioned before, even with the original selection we made had a
mix of editioned and 'unique' works to be printed - which was not flagged).
He apologised for missing this but did say that having other prints
(physical) with or without the NFT component to it, ""floating around"" on
the market is a ""no-go"".

From what I understand, all printed additional works of the selection that
was made for Sotheby's are not signed and vary in size. We could therefore
assume that these were 'reference prints' as Tom mentioned in some of his
findings and the intention of Harold's was always to publish the full
edition, but it never happened (as far as these 9 works go).

For future sales of any of these 9 works, if the need arises, we could
argue that the work will not be considered as part of this edition as it
will be reprinted posthumously and signed off by HCT. Thus, although the
image is the same, the work that will be on offer at Sotheby's is still
argued to be unique.

What do you think?
Happy to chat through over a call if easier.

Speak soon,
Mila

Basically the idea is to use all we know about an artist — the art, writing, exhibitions, email, lectures, correspondence, photos etc. — to build a really thorough, organized, conversational catalogue raisonne. I’ve started work on such a thing for Harold based on some earlier work on machine reading, machine learning, knowledge curation and other stuff. Anthropic say they’re interested. We have until next week to get a 3-pager done. If they like it then we have a couple of months to write a proper proposal. 

Can you let me know if you are interested and whether I can add you as a participant, please. Many thanks, —P"

Would this work? (They are planning to have the title as “The first

Assuming you are happy with the COI, the next step is to sign the form and
return to Dietl.
This is required ahead of the collection because the document covers
elements of liability / insurance (should anything happen when they visit /
review the works) which is more in relation to what Gazelli's broker would
need to do in the event of an incident (claim within 1 year, etc.)

Once Dietl has the document they will come back to you to schedule a
convenient visit day / time for you to review all the works that are
shipping, and will return on a later date with all the necessary packing
supplies.

I'll reach out to my contact at Dietl and see if he needs any additional
information, and to check he has the latest list with all the details.

Michael.

are unique, hence we cannot have the auction. I hold Sotheby's responsible
for this, unless they gave us a contract earlier that specifies that
uniqueness is a requirement and defines uniqueness. We've worked pretty
hard as they have moved the goalposts, but this is one move too far, too

Before responding to this request, I wanted to check in with you to see if the Trust would rather handle this request directly, in which case I'd be happy to connect you with Cengage, or more generally to see if you are amenable to this type of project. Many thanks for your thoughts, and I'd be happy to pass along any questions you may have regarding the project.

Best,

Thank you so much for this.

If none of the images are exactly the same, then why do you think he
editioned them?
I've mentioned this in the other email just now too, do we know if any of
the other 'editions' of the 9 works selected were/are signed?
Paul, let me have a chat with Michael as I mentioned, will report back with
how we can navigate this as I think it is a matter of getting the wording
right so it is not misleading but also comforts both parties.
Will have a think about it but in the meantime, might something like this
be more in line with what we are trying to say? :
*Each work is a unique, signed edition with no other editions available
with an accompanying ERC-721 token.*

My best,
Mila

I will make the appropriate corrections. I have a question. We have this big 9x15 foot painting (i23-4425) from 1968 in the DOT style — see attached. I unrolled it last year to inventory and it looks gorgeous. But it stunk to high heaven and was causing the other works to stink. So I rolled it backup rolling it in heavy paper, then rolled it with plastic and taped it up. I then stored it in the spray room which has ventilation to the outside and is away from all the other artworks. I don’t know what happened to this work but I am wondering if it can be saved and/or if it should be saved. The artwork is so large I had to use the pan feature to capture the entire image. This means the wavy edges are not wavy they are straight. I am wondering if this is something we should send at this time? Of course it would need to be sent with care. Let me know your thoughts.

Dear Gazelli Team,Below is a link to the 2025 Artwork Shipment List. This list is a work in progress and not complete. I ran into a problem with some of the portrait paintings dates. I am not sure why but some of them have the wrong dates so I am reviewing all of them. I did notice some other inconsistancies in the artlogic document compared to the original notes sometime ago but have not done a comprehensive review as of yet. In any case, I am plugging away at creating the list you can see most of it here. I need to move some items around to access some additional works which may be approximately 4 more items. Currently there are 54 items to be shipped. That is quite of few and I want to make sure everything it correct so I appreciate your patience as it will take a bit longer to complete. I do have most of the measurements that were not in the original artlogic doc George sent and hope to have all the measurements by Thursday or at least an estimated measurement as I suspect the measurements are important to the shipper. 
Here is the link. If you are unable to view this please let me know.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11MqbW2pAIPfUA4YNC6AHWu09PPzyM20-YvIF8nedKNs/edit?usp=sharing

As to credits, the ones for software usually don't go to that level of detail (e.g. on tombstone labels), but I think it would be nice to either credit everyone who contributed to the code or make a distinction between animation / subroutines with individual credit wherever it's appropriate.

Thanks again, hope you're all well!

Moving you to BCC.

Paul and Tom, nice to meet you—and thank you for the quick response. As Christiane mentioned, I’m the curator for the arts program at San Diego International Airport. One of my roles is organizing temporary exhibitions that showcase contemporary art from the region. These are themed exhibitions that bring together a variety of artists in dialogue around a central idea.

We’re currently developing concepts for upcoming shows, and as more San Diego-based artists explore the use of AI as a creative partner, we thought it would be timely to feature that subject. Given Harold Cohen’s pioneering contributions to the field—and his connection to San Diego—we wanted to reach out about potential ways to incorporate his work or legacy as a thread in the exhibition.

I’d love to set up a time to talk. Would you be available next week—either Thursday between 3:30–5:00 PM or Friday after 1:00 PM?

Thanks so much,

morning.

I understand that you inventoried roughly 4000 works and there are still
some to be done. Knowing that it'll take a while to do the remaining
inventory, what do you think of the following idea: Could you make a rough
classification of what remains to be inventoried? Here's my thinking: We
need a five-year plan for raising prices, so we need to know the whole
inventory, but we're most concerned about high-valued works, and
particularly how many we have (i.e., rarity). If you knew, for example,
that we have 20 paintings in a particular category, then for the purpose of
strategic planning we wouldn't need to inventory them immediately, because
just knowing that there are 20 would be hugely helpful. What do you think?

The other topic is storage. We're both concerned about storing work in the
house simply because the house is old and not very secure. Again wrt
high-value work we could ship more of it to London (or New York if Mila
does in fact open a gallery there) or to local safe storage in San Diego.
What do you think?"

This has been a surprisingly rich learning experience (how's that for a
positive spin!) particularly this most recent issue. It is sure to happen
again, or something similar that could cause a token to be withdrawn, so I
wonder whether there's any general method to deal with these cases. For
example, is there any notion of a provisional NFT or does that undermine
the whole idea of NFTs. When I buy a house, I sign one contract saying
that I intend to buy it, but this isn't the contract that formalizes
ownership. That comes later, after various inspections are passed."

Harold Cohen: AARON | Whitney Museum of American Art<https://whitney.org/exhibitions/harold-cohen-aaron>
This exhibition traces the evolution of Harold Cohens AARON, the earliest artificial intelligence (AI) program for artmaking. Leaving behind his practice as an established painter in London, Cohen (19282016) conceived the software in the late 1960s at the University of California, San Diego, and named it AARON in the early 1970s.

Great to hear from you.

I've attached the shipping document for the 18 Figurative works on canvas
that fit within your 6 parameters. I have attached a list which has images,
plus the link here:

<https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/f5fcb1f56f9ce5a013b84a/>.

Not to distract from the shipping project, but can you also please check if
there are any additional works with you that fit your parameters that are
not listed here?

Regarding the Painting Machine works. We have a total of 18 in London. This
list includes sold works, plus two that are consigned from Tom Gruber.
Here's the list: https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/237bf664d6efbf6f724c20/

According to your document 'Preliminary WIP', you have 17 works remaining
in the HCT collection? They are TCM5, TCM7, TCM8, TCM9, TCM10, TCM12,
TCM13, TCM18, TCM24, TCM25, TCM27 (signed and framed), TCM101, TCM102,
TCM104, TCM105, TCM106, TCM108. I have put together a document with the
images and titles attached.

Can you please include these works with the shipment of the figurative
canvas too? Our timeframe would be in the early New Year, if possible?

As always, we are here to help, so please do get in touch with any
outstanding questions or concerns.

Very best wishes,

I was unaware of the upcoming Christie's auction as I was probably not in the loop. No matter, I will do what I can with the allotted time available. Understanding does change over time and therefore this reply is based on the current understanding. I attached a memo Harold wrote in 1993. His memo addresses the work from the same time period as the i23-3758 up for auction at Christie’s. These clarifications regarding Harold’s work tend to be tricky. One of the problems with the word “Series” in English is that series is both singular and plural. Please keep that in mind. 

In the memo below, Harold writes about two main phases of AARON, Primitive and Knowledgable. The first of these two Harold called “Primitive”. Time wise Primitive works are Pre-1980. The second phase he called “Knowledgable"" (Post-1980). The Knowledgable phase is the one that i23-3758 belongs to. According to his memo, 1980s can basically be cut in half. The first half (1980-1985) Harold does not name but I will call Early Knowledge. The second half Harold called is the “provision of a physical ambience” or I will called Ambience for short.  And 1985 is basically transitional. In 1985 Harold begins the transition by developing human figures in motion. This is quickly followed by him adding Ambience for the human figures. First we see Statues of Liberty figures, then the Athletes and the Bathers. And then later we see works like i23-3758.

In his memo Harold refers to AARON as having the knowledge to generate anything from a quasi-daisy to a quasi oak-tree. A collection of these qausi-plants becomes the ambience. He claims that this knowledge was capable of providing for a very large number of drawings and that this group was referred to as “Eden Series.” Unfortunately, it is difficult to know if series is singular or plural. He then says that some friends refer to these works as ""Yuppies in the Jungle."" 

Based on Harold’s memo, I rather think the two terms “Eden Series” and “Yuppies in the Jungle” are interchangeable. However, in the studio where items are labelled, there is a specific group of works identified as Yuppies in the Jungle or YIJ. Also in the studio there are multiple groups of works labelled as “Jungle Drawings.”  Not to add to the confusion, there is also a (2013) painting titled Eden. This later work is one of a group of works where Harold revisited earlier works. 

So, based on the way I interpret what Harold wrote, the i23-3758 is both from the Eden Series (where series is plural noun) and from the Jungle Drawing series (series as a singular noun). Eden seems to be more of an umbrella group of multiple series of works. And where Jungle Drawings is a subset series of Eden. 

This is the best reply I can provide at this time. Let me know if you have any questions,

Tom"

I needed to reply to Michael Pollard of Gazelli regarding this. Looks like I didn’t cc you so here is what I sent to Michael. 

Hi Michael,

Regarding Dietl, I am a bit conflicted on some issues. One, when they refer to “Customer” exactly who is that? Is Gazelli the customer or HCT? OR jointly? If it is HCT, then there are multiple places in the document whereby HCT needs to agree to unspecified terms and that makes me feel a bit uneasy due to the value of the shipment and since we have never dealt with Dietl before. And since we have no proven track record with them. 

One example of agreeing to unspecified terms is in part 4a. It reads, “Customer understands that the terms and conditions under which DIS’ services are provided are subject to change. Customer is advised to take note of the most current terms and conditions which are posted on DIS’ web site and which are also available to Customer upon request. Customer agrees that the posted terms and conditions on DIS’ website on the date of a shipment will apply to that shipment and govern the parties’ obligations.”  At a minimum we need to review the most current terms. However, even the current terms are subject to change until the date of the shipment. 

And part 1 reads, “Customer understands that the terms and conditions of the storage receipts of warehousemen, and contracts of carriage of air, land and/or ocean carriers that DIS retains will apply to Customer as if Customer had entered into those contracts itself. “ We don’t know these terms in advance  and is another example of agreeing to unspecified terms. 

Also in part 1 it reads, Customer warrants that the goods are properly marked, addressed, and packaged to withstand any contemplated method of transport. This is currently not the case, only marking for identification purposes is done.

In section 1A it reads, DIS WILL ONLY HONOR INSURANCE CLAIMS WHEN FEES ARE CHARGED ON AN INVOICE AND PAID TO DIS FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE ON THE SHIPMENT IN WHICH THE CLAIM OCCURRED.  I understand and have received your notice regarding insurance with Lloyd’s of London. My concern is that the way this reads, it sounds like if we do need to make an insurance claim, Dietl will not recognize a 3rd party insurance and therefore under no obligation to be forthcoming with any requests related to a claim with Lloyd’s of London. If so, is that problematic when making a claim them?

In section 1C it reads, Customer warrants that it shall consider DIS’ Customer Supply Chain Security Recommendations as posted on DIS’ website. We need the link to this so we can review it.

In section 1D it read,  Customer agrees to inspect its shipment upon delivery and give prompt notice of any loss or damage within 5 days of delivery for air or ground shipments and within 3 days of

delivery for ocean shipments.  If HCT is the “Customer”, how do we go about this inspection? 

With respect to section 2E “DIS GIVEN A LIEN ON GOODS FOR UNPAID CHARGES”. This goes back to who is the “Customer” and thereby who is the responsible party for payments?

Dear Paul & Mila,
Below are two links. One is to the Providence + Metadata document. The other is a link to the file folder to make the NFTs. I know that previously I sent the files for the NFTs but if possible please use these because I used these files to extract the metadata. While most of them are the same, there are some slight differences. So if possible, please use the ones in the link below.

I was not sure how to word some of the Providence events so if necessary you can change it so long as the events are intact. I was not sure how to word what ""aa"" files are. Internally, I typically refer to them as AARON Vector files but the more I thought about it the more I realized that AARON vector files are really the generation before where the vector (black line drawing file) and color file were two different files. The aa files have additional information on how to make the artwork besides just vectors. Keeping that in mind I used ""AARON Artwork descriptor file"" instead of AARON Artwork vector file. I would prefer to reserve the term AARON Artwork vector file for the drawing files that truly are lists of vectors.
As mentioned earlier, all of the jpegs were made by Harold at a later date. I found those dates and included them on the second line. The last line I listed that the file name was changed. We don't exactly know how he created the jpegs so I had to be vague about the process and simply put the date followed by, ""Harold Cohen completes jpeg conversion, names file"" then put the file name.
There was one jpeg that was corrupted. We currently do not have a way to convert aa files into jpegs. Fortunately, we have a Postscript file of the same work that was generated within one minute of the original aa file. I used the postscript file to make a jpeg file. So in this instance, there is no aa file listed since it was not directly involved in the making the jpg. I included my name as the one who made the conversion in case that is relevant. But can be removed with no skin off my back. In the case of the file name changes, I simply put HCT changed the names.
Regarding the Metadata, some files have much more metadata available than others. I chose to limit some of the metadata so as to keep the group basically the same. 

There was much data to enter by hand. I have checked it multiple times but after a good night sleep will check it one last time. If you find any inconsistencies, feel free to correct or ask me about it, Tom

 Hi George,

 Tom,

 I
 don’t have the invoice for this painting. I inherited it from
 Gordon and Gwen Bell, who were its&nbsp;original owners. Do you have a
 copy of the invoice for this? It would be from 1988 or
 possibly a year or two later.

 Thanks
 everyone for all your help.

Can I ask two things, please. First, please invoice the HCT for the work.
Second, if you are willing to continue on the project, then I'd like to
have a zoom call with you and Sascha, who is CTO at Verisart. Briefly the
idea is to publish two catalogs raisonne, one a handsome print volume that
doesn't include everything, the other an exhaustive, searchable listing
accessible from the HCT web site. The question is whether Verisart can
serve records to the web site easily. If so, then 1) everything can be on
chain, 2) we can augment Verisart records with information they cannot
currently handle, such as Tom's provenance notes or facsimiles of
exhibition catalogs. I think we should run a little experiment to see
whether Verisart can serve a record when requested from the HCT website
client. I might also be totally off-base about the right way to get the
functionality we want! If you are interested, can you suggest some times
we might chat with Sascha, keeping in mind the eight-hour time difference.

Beautiful work, thank you!"

Great to hear from you.

Yes, we are all on the same page with regards to Mila's idea of pricing the
medium-sized works on canvas in relation to their 'quality'. The four works
I highlighted would be priced at £150,000, and the first 'batch' we can
sell.

Regarding the Art Fairs strategy, I think the best route forward is to
decide on the selection depending on which fairs we get into. Currently we
are in the process of applying for/waiting to be invited to, both Armory
NYC and Dallas. So we can make a selection once we get in? But either way,
are we agreed that the four paintings I highlighted are ok to be priced at
£150,000?

Regarding Tom Gruber, we are getting a good deal if we buy his work, but it
is a purchase decision, so I will leave it up to you both.

The Artsy alert is in relation to a group show we have curated over the
Christmas and New Year period called 'Quiet Motion'. We have priced the 60s
work at £100,000. The pricing is aligned with the 60s canvases we showed
during 'Refactoring'.

Let me know if that's all clear? We're really excited to see what Tom will
send over in the roll!

With warmest wishes,

George Barke

At first glance I would say, the photo of the work initialed by Harold as ""HC 72"" may have been signed by Harold in 1972, but it is highly unlikely it would have been plotted in 1972. 1972 was characterized by plotted Maze drawings. Drawings plotted on his first generation of plotters. Again at first glance I would put this in 1969 and possibly a transition work from away from Contours. 
Upon second glance, because it is initialed and had not formally signed it, in a sense has a different meaning to Harold. So I need to think outside of the box on this one. For example, I recall seeing pages and pages of notes in Harold’s notebooks of number drawn in the style similar to the ones in the “HC 72.”"

I have looked at the cataloguing for “Tomorrow’s World” on 22 March 2000, and it does include an item with the following details:

ITEM 06: TURING TEST: TW's 3rd Turing Test: Can people identify paintings by computers from paintings by humans?

I have viewed the item, it mentions Harold Cohen but gives very little other information – it shows a computer artwork with the result of a test (as in the item title) to see how many people in a sample could tell which of three options was generated by machine. This edition of “Tomorrow’s World” was billed as “Live Lab” and was a special programme for National Science Week, including a number of live experiments and tests.

“Tomorrow’s World” was a long-running popular science magazine programme, usually covering new inventions and techniques.

Kind regards

Dear Andrew,

Previously you helped me with requests regarding British artist Harold Cohen (1928-2016). I hope you can help with my latest request. We have an internal document claiming that the BBC aired a show titled “Tomorrow’s World” on or around March 22, 2000. Our understanding is that Harold Cohen’s AARON was included in this program. Do you have any evidence in your archives of this? If so can you share any details of what may have been included in the program or why Harold Cohen’s AARON was included?"

1) the nine works on their way to Sotheby's are all signed (and if they
aren't all signed, how many are)

2) For each work, can we say with reasonable certainty that it is unique in
the sense that there is not another signed work from the same edition in
someone's possession.

I think the answer to question 1 is that all nine works are signed, and the
answer to question 2 is that some of these works belong to editions and we
know or suspect that other works from those editions are floating around in
the big wide world.

Please let me know as soon as you can."

Thank you for getting back to me with this additional information.

This edition of the series “Sunday Night” seems to have been very unfortunate as we have almost all of the other editions of the series, which ran from 1965-66. I’m not sure if we have any paperwork relating to the series which would give any clue as to its retention history, any such paperwork, if it exists, would be with BBC Written Archives. I think it’s fairly unlikely that the British Council would still have a copy of “Five Artists” but it may be worth asking them; I don’t have a specific contact there, but there should be contact details on their website if you want to make enquiries yourself.

I will put together a list of what other material we do hold about Harold Cohen and get back to you with that asap.

Dear Andrew,
Much thanks for looking into our requests and for the quick response. Sorry for my delayed response as I was following up on another lead regarding the Director of Sunday Night: Five for Venice.

I understand the ""Sunday Night: Five for Venice"" is no longer extant in your archives. I have since found some additional information which confirms what you wrote but also hope that maybe a copy still is extant. I understand the late Ann Turner (1927-2018) was the film director of the programme. In a voice recorded interviewed by Alan Lawson in 1995 she provides the details on the films demise where she says*(see note below), ""BBC One, I had a five for Venice on the 25th of October in 1966. I'd spent a year following around the British Council something we could never do these days. Actually, with the five artists concern, which are known as Tony Cairo, Danny Cairo, Robin Denny now CBE, the two Cohen's Harold and Bernard and Dick Smith and Lillian Somerville, Sir Herbert Read. David Thompson was involved as the catalogue was his. And I think it's a very interesting film. And I would very much like to see it except BBC lent it to Nancy for ?OU? thing. Humphrey had not signed the retention order. And the thing was junked with its negative when it came back to film library, Alan Hanson nearly went through the roof, because you know all those artists are important. And they were all in their studios talking about their work.""

That is a pity. But Ann Turner goes on to say later in the interview,""One of the things I have not followed up is if whether the British Council, I may simply have given them a copy with luck, they might have kept it you know."" Do you have any thoughts on how I would approach the British Council to ask if they have a copy?

Also regarding the other finds. This is wonderful news. What do we need to do to get a listing of sorts from you?"

The printed certificate mockup looks good, thanks. I scanned the QR code

traits for the opensea NFT mockup are as we discussed. For Tom's benefit,
the traits describe the NFT, not the physical print. Traits do however
include the fact that a print is included. Traits are searchable.

I'm not sure of the purpose of the pdfs, two of them look like they are
parts of a contractual agreement w Sotheby's. For the one that deals with
NFTs, I assume this is where you will add the provenance/metadata material
you'll be getting from Tom? WRT the final doc, which includes the
certificate of authenticity, the NFT and the Configuration, I have a couple
of observations: 1) the second paragraph of the NFT will be slightly
different for most of the NFTs because the dates will be different and so
will the jpeg metadata, and because in one case we need to that the jpeg
was made by Tom in 2024. 2) In ""professional bio"" under ""opensea

It is sure to happen again, or something similar that could cause a token to be withdrawn, so I wonder whether there's any general method to deal with these cases. For example, is there any notion of a provisional NFT or does that undermine the whole idea of NFTs. When I buy a house, I sign one contract saying that I intend to buy it, but this isn't the contract that formalizes ownership. That comes later, after various inspections are passed.

George,

The works at Documenta ’77 were ink on paper drawn by the Turtle. According to notes/correspondences from Harold, he claims they were given to schools. I have found no evidence of the potential names of the schools. Basically the same answer for the Stedlijk show also 1977. These too were works on paper given to schools yet to be located. 

As for the full color paintings that are not murals, there are 3:

 - 
RA26 now with Tate previously shown at they 1979 Reno Nevada show and also known as Reno 2 or AARON Drawing #1

 - 
RA40 sent to Gazelli also shown previously at Reno and known as Reno 1

 - 
RA46 now with Thoma not known to have been shown at a show prior to the Thoma acquisition – was shown on TV while in process of being painted

As for the 1979 SFMOMA show, two things were going on. One, the Turtle was making drawings on paper just like Stedlijk and Documenta. Two, the mural behind him was executed onsite. I don’t yet know what happened to the mural. We might have the mural panels in the studio or we might not. I did open one of the folded panels a few years ago. That panel looked like a panel from the early 1980s – possibly the one shown at the Tate in the early 1980s. It was certainly not 1979. I could try opening up other panels but it may need to wait as the only space to accommodate the size of these panels is the living room and the family has visitors this week. That is, unless, I can figure something else out. I hope we have it as that would explain what happened to the SFMOMA mural. I know this maybe a whole ‘nother’ can of worms but there are other pre-1980 murals. They may not necessarily be paintings on canvas but they may exist in public space. This is on our list to do but not much has been down towards that yet.

 Hi Tom, 
Many thanks for getting back to me. 
Apologies for any confusion. My question was: do you know if there are any of the large 'Turtle' paintings, aside from the Tate, in public/museum collections? I was wondering if any of the museum shows where he produced those works (image attached, SFMoMA 1979, for example) had kept them in their permanent collection. But if, as you say 'there are “no"" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows'. Then that's the answer. I'm curious what happened to them, but I guess they were destroyed and not acquired by the Museums at the time? 
Thanks for sending over such a detailed document of the work in the Tate collection too. I really appreciate the in-depth research. 
Thanks again,

Hi George,

I am not sure I understand the question correctly. So, just to be clear, of the three shows you mention, there are “no"" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows. 

If we are referring to canvas works, there were 3 executed after these shows. One is now at the Tate. One is with Thoma. And we sent you the 3rd one. We have a 4th canvas work that is black lines only in the studio – no coloring. I did a detailed investigation for Valentina Ravaglia of the Tate into their work (RA26) for their Electric Dreams which you can view here if interested. 

RA26 (Oct 1979) - A Deeper Look

Shortly after I began working for Harold, he had me destroy a canvas work which may have been from that same period. But I really don’t know. It might have been more recent. 

We have a tiny collection of early non-canvas works. These are folded cloth works. Some are multi-panel-mural works, others a single panel. I hope to get to document them this year. The time period range of these works is not known but I rather think they are late 1970s early 1980s. 

If there are additional works out there, I am not aware of them. When I looked into the details and origins of the Tate’s RA26, I did not come across any information suggesting more than the known 4 canvas works were executed in the 1977-1979 style of AARON. 

Hope that helps, if you need anything else let me know,

Tom

Aside from the Tate, do you know how many of the large Turtle paintings are in museum or public collections? Shows at that time include Documenta 6, group show (1977), Stedejilk, solo show (1977) and SFMoMA, solo (1979).

	Paul Cohen <team@haroldcohentrust.org>",2024-09-26 19:29:46,"Thu, 26 Sep 2024 19:29:46 -0400",<CAKjPZkFGwmodMxa827CphwJeenLLqgo0cP9vsubWi280PXEu3w@mail.gmail.com>,"Mila, the viability of your suggestion depends on the definition of
edition. As I understand the terms, works and editions are different. An
edition is k>1 identical works. So I don't know what your assertion ""Each
work is a unique, signed edition...."" means. ""A work is an edition"" can be
true only if the edition is of size 1, which defies the ordinary meaning of
edition.

So what is Sotheby's really asking for? Let X be a work that is part of
edition E of at least two identical works. Are they asking for X to be
unique? If so, then they are asking us to assert that X is not part of E,
which is a known falsehood. Are they asking that E be unique but X need
not be unique? This is more interesting. Suppose E1 is an edition of three
identical prints and E2 is an edition of the same three prints. Are E1 and
E2 *unique* editions? Perhaps E1 was printed on Tuesday and E2 was printed
on Wednesday, and to an expert eye the works in E1 look very slightly
different than the works in E2. Then we could assert that E1 and E2 are
unique, in which case your phrase ""E1 is a unique signed edition with no
other editions"" would be false because there are two discernably different
editions of ""the same"" work. But if we have only one edition, then it is
by definition a unique edition with no other editions.

In short, we cannot assert that any work is unique, as we know that (for
some or perhaps all the works) they belong to editions. We can assert that
the *editions* are unique, in the sense that we printed edition E1 on
Tuesday and we did not print another edition on Wednesday or ever. However
we can not say, as you suggest, *Each work is a unique, signed edition with
no other editions available with an accompanying ERC-721 token* because we
cannot say a work is an edition.

We *can* say, *Each work is from a unique, signed edition with no other
editions available with an accompanying ERC-721 token. *However, if we say
this then we will never be allowed to make another edition of a work, as we
hoped to do.

The annoying thing is that we thought all this through carefully several
weeks ago and now, at the last minute, people who really ought to
understand editioning, and who never put anything about it in a contract,
and who seem not to understand that this is supposed to be an NFT sale,
have imposed an impossible or at least highly disadvantageous restriction
upon us."

By the way, I will continue to search for Harold’s printout codes.

This code printout that I sent you I found in my tenure package case, so things may get misfiled.

 Dear George,I am continuing to work on your list of 15 works to potentially add to the shipment. And, I came across one which is not quite the same as the “HC 72” work that you asked about earlier, but similar. The one attached is i23-3014 (most likely your HC4014). This is part of folio of 4 works (folio also attached i23-3012 to i23-3015) all claiming to be silkscreen prints. Paul may have more thoughts since he reconstructed the Mazes. But I wonder if all those numbers both for i23-3014 and the “HC 72""  are actually expressions of what Harold was representing inside the computer program. Almost like a sketch of sorts.Tom

 Hi George,Good to here from you. Yes, Harold did exhibit in Texas as part of a touring exhibition called “Mapped Art” curated by Peter Frank. Mapped Art toured from 1982 to 1990 and the Austin, Texas leg was the last one. I am not sure what piece or pieces toured. But I believe one piece was of a pre-AARON Map style work of Harold's. Possible a labelled Map work from the early 1970ish. I might be able to dig that information out if need be. 
BTW, Harold’s pieces owned by Thoma exhibited in their Santa Fe, New Mexico Gallery. Thoma may have a facility in Texas but as far as I know Harold/AARON has not exhibited in Texas with Thoma.
Here is the list of exhibitions related to Mapped Art along with the dates. It was curated by And below that is a link to the 
""Mapped Art” 
University of Colorado Art Gallery (May 2, 1992 to Jun 7, 1982)Toledo Museum of Art (Nov 13, 1982 - Jan 2, 1983)Arkansas Arts Center ((Aug 7, 1987 - Sep 20, 1987)University of Texas Art Gallery, Austin (Aug 31, 1990 - Oct 17, 1990)

Thanks so much for getting back to me, I appreciate it.

Is the good friend of Harold you spoke to interested in selling? It's
important for us to try and avoid the risk of Cohen's work appearing in
public auction, and we'd be delighted to have a conversation with them
about a possible sale. Either way, it's great that you've had the chance to
look through the inventory, and discovered one of the panels from 'The Age
of Intelligent Machines'!

It has been a real pleasure working with you all over the past few years.
It's been a personal point of pride to have been involved in helping
expand the audience for Harold's work.

Thanks again Tom, and everyone :)

 Hi Mila, I don't think we should authenticate work without a lawyer standing by, but that said, the image that looks vaguely like a tree, initialed HC, is not like anything I've seen from Harold.  But that doesn't mean much.  Given the signature and the date it could be Harold's rough idea of what he was aiming for, but then I'd expect it to be in a notebook and none of the notebooks I've seen has anything like it. 

Whereas the two images called painting two and painting two almost certainly are Harold's.  We have the notebooks where he designed the numbers.  These works are in shockingly bad shape!"

*With regards to the packing*, ideally, yes, the collecting agent would be
able to use a space in order to pack the works, at least for local transit.
Once we know which works are being collected, I will pick/schedule a
shipper and will put them in touch with you Tom, in order to schedule a
convenient day/time and help ensure the works are collected promptly.

The other points will need to be answered by *George/Mila*:
-Shall we send any posters?
-Shall we send any or all of the large framed works sitting on the floor?
-Shall we send Harold's last Fingerpainting?

the nine works. Each document will contain provenance for the jpeg and the
metadata for the jpeg.

Just so you know, the provenance will say (for most of the works) that
Aaron generated a vector file in a custom format designed by Harold called
the ""AA"" format. Tom will say when each AA file was created. Then the AA
files were transformed to JPEGs. This happened later, mostly in 2005. Tom
will say when it happened for each work. However, for one work, Harold's
JPEG was corrupted. Tom found a postscript file for that work and created a
JPEG for it in 2024. The JPEG has the same parameters (reflected in the
metadata) as the originals. The provenance will identify Tom as Harold's
Studio Manager.

Tom says he can get this done within a few hours."

Harold Cohen: AARON | Whitney Museum of American Art<https://whitney.org/exhibitions/harold-cohen-aaron>
This exhibition traces the evolution of Harold Cohens AARON, the earliest artificial intelligence (AI) program for artmaking. Leaving behind his practice as an established painter in London, Cohen (19282016) conceived the software in the late 1960s at the University of California, San Diego, and named it AARON in the early 1970s.

Hello Thomas,
Apologies for the delay here.The total value requires me to submit these for an additional 'premium', or specific transit cover.All the details are with our broker and they should come back to me tomorrow with confirmation of the 'premium' and a copy of the COI.

I sent George the information he requested. Assuming we are not adding any additional works, can you send us a certificate of insurance based on the values I put in the shipment list at this link?

Hi Thomas,
Thanks so much for the additional information you provided yesterday.  We wanted to run a few changes by you which have been picked up by our team.

 - We noticed that the Birdie Taylor gallery is referred to online as the Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery online - should we go with this version? ie.  Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery
 - We suggest using Harold Cohen Trust instead as HCT as believe this is clearer.  Are you OK with this?
 - Should we change paper to Roland PQM-CRBW-33-50 paper? Or are you not sure if all prints are on this type of paper? 

 - Some of the file sizes are slightly different to what you wrote when we double checked them on our end.  See below for more information.  Are you OK with these changes?

I wanted to ask you a question regarding the how captured the numerous KCAT and Maze drawings. As I recall, you generated a collection of files in advance and then basically replayed them at the Whitney in a slowed down mode. I believe the KCAT program can only make 16 different files and on the 17th it starts overwriting the previous ones. How did you go about collecting the 1000+ KCAT files?  I am also assuming you had some kind of automated process. Then when you were playing back/plotting the files at the Whitney what were you using to do the playback?  I believe you shared previously during the playback/plotting the KCAT and Maze files were pre-converted meaning they were not do so on the fly."

idea of what he was aiming for, but then I'd expect it to be in a notebook

Whereas the two images called painting two and painting two almost
certainly are Harold's. We have the notebooks where he designed the

After contacting Erin, she was able to verify that one of the works was generated in 2001 and thus adding credence to my findings. She wasn’t sure about the other two. She did however make the following comment, “I did not paint them. Nor did I see Harold paint them.” I have found digital files with similar imagery. I am not sure what we do about sending or not sending these as they may not actually be Harold Cohen works.

And, I came across one which is not quite the same as the “HC 72” work that you asked about earlier, but similar. The one attached is i23-3014 (most likely your HC4014). This is part of folio of 4 works (folio also attached i23-3012 to i23-3015) all claiming to be silkscreen prints. Paul may have more thoughts since he reconstructed the Mazes. But I wonder if all those numbers both for i23-3014 and the “HC 72""  are actually expressions of what Harold was representing inside the computer program. Almost like a sketch of sorts.Tom

 Hi George,Good to here from you. Yes, Harold did exhibit in Texas as part of a touring exhibition called “Mapped Art” curated by Peter Frank. Mapped Art toured from 1982 to 1990 and the Austin, Texas leg was the last one. I am not sure what piece or pieces toured. But I believe one piece was of a pre-AARON Map style work of Harold's. Possible a labelled Map work from the early 1970ish. I might be able to dig that information out if need be. 
BTW, Harold’s pieces owned by Thoma exhibited in their Santa Fe, New Mexico Gallery. Thoma may have a facility in Texas but as far as I know Harold/AARON has not exhibited in Texas with Thoma.
Here is the list of exhibitions related to Mapped Art along with the dates. It was curated by And below that is a link to the 
""Mapped Art” 
University of Colorado Art Gallery (May 2, 1992 to Jun 7, 1982)Toledo Museum of Art (Nov 13, 1982 - Jan 2, 1983)Arkansas Arts Center ((Aug 7, 1987 - Sep 20, 1987)University of Texas Art Gallery, Austin (Aug 31, 1990 - Oct 17, 1990)

Dear Paul and Tom, 
Hope you are both doing well? I'm doing some research on any connections between Harold and Texas but drawing a bit of a blank... I am looking for any shows he might've had or any collections there. I can't see anything obvious from the CV we have, but perhaps you might know? 
Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hope you both are having a good February. 

I don’t know if you still have Dr Thomas Gruber’s Machine Painting or not. But in case you do, I’d like to share the following discovery. In our 1996 VHS video of the BBC One show, “It’ll Never Work”, we can see Dr Gruber’s Machine Painting being executed. The 4 ½ minute segment is chopped up and not necessarily presented chronologically but it does show the work being made from start to end in pieces. The segment starts at 4m01s and goes to 8m34s. A partial view of our Machine Painting TCM#19 (i24-0076) is visible shown as a completed work. Also visible during the segment are 2 Amsterdam drawings, multiple Early People drawings and multiple 1990s paintings. Please find attached a slide showing half dozen screenshots from the TV show showing the work's progression from start to end. And here the link to the video for your viewing. Again it starts at 4minutes. Tom"

HCT Invoice for Oct 2024 Work - Thomas Machnik <zipnpup@yahoo.com> - 2024-11-24 0018.eml,HCT Invoice for Oct 2024 Work,Thomas Machnik <zipnpup@yahoo.com>,"Paul Cohen <paulrcohen@gmail.com>, Paul Cohen <prcohen@pitt.edu>",,2024-11-24 05:18:46,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 05:18:46 +0000 (UTC)",<658128390.856024.1732425527106@mail.yahoo.com>,"Hi Paul, 
Please find attached my invoice for Oct 2024. 

During the Auction crunch Griselda helped out and that is included in the invoice. Most of the time in Oct prior to the auction was dedicated to fielding questions and such for the auction. Since that time primarily what I have been working on is checking the condition of the various digital media (of the ones I can check) and copying over what can be read into one place. Some of this was done before but was primarily code and that drive is not reaching the potential limit of its life so a new copy is needed.

This previous copy was copied over to a new drive along with the newer code that was recovered. I have also added the scanned snippets of code from non-digital sources like paper, notebooks and film. In addition to code, all of the AARON generated digital artwork is being copied over. Videos and audio recordings have been copied over. The last main category that has to copied over are the various correspondences, notes and such. Most everything has been copied over. I do have some non-code files to copy over from the two RedHat machines Harold used. Fortunately, I was able to get them to boot. So I can do that next week. I should therefore be able to have the master back up done soon. I will then make two backups from the master thereby having triple backup. At this time the master backup is approximately 1.5 Terabytes.
I have already purchased the drives but was unable to use the HCT card for the purchase. So when I get the bill I will include that on my next invoice. 

Some of this coping effort has taken a backseat this past week. I don't know if you have been in the loop regarding a 1971 Map painting that was sold. Michael of Gazelli needs to know when the painting was exported to the UK in order to obtain an export license. This is apparently because the painting is more than 50 years old.

Unfortunately, finding this in formation has to do with the storage rabbit hole spanning an unknown number of years. And of course this painting does not have a name. Also photos were not included in older documentation. I am reviewing the scant documents we have. Michael asked if the Trust would be able to provide document of some kind. I am not sure would exactly we would need to provide. Although, he did seem to suggest we provide a date range. That is what I am hoping to provide with some kind of documentary evidence. 

However, I am wondering if that is really necessary. The chain of events as I understand is that the 1971 Map painting was inventoried last year by Gazelli. That should mean that the work was in the same storage facility while Harold was alive right? Since it was his property, property that he made, I wonder if that puts the work in a different category and not subject to this 50 years. 

I will keep looking an don't mind doing so but it could be a long slog unless we can find an alternative.

Basically the idea is to use all we know about an artist — the art, writing, exhibitions, email, lectures, correspondence, photos etc. — to build a really thorough, organized, conversational catalogue raisonne. I’ve started work on such a thing for Harold based on some earlier work on machine reading, machine learning, knowledge curation and other stuff. Anthropic say they’re interested. We have until next week to get a 3-pager done. If they like it then we have a couple of months to write a proper proposal.

This is the update.

I have yet to find any shipping documents of any kind. I did find and 
looked through the 1976 Edinburgh show put on by the Scottish Art 
Council. According to the show list, there were 3 similar works shown 
but none match the size nor the description. So I think we can rule that 
out.

I did, however, find a group of previously unscanned 35mm slides that 
claim to be associated with the (British) Arts Council. Unfortunately 
there are no dates but I assume these are inventory storage photographs. 
All the slides are numbered but set into two groups:  'S' and 'R'. The

There was an email from Deb Hendel and I thought maybe SANY0005 was part of their collection. But the email from Deb Hendel was to simply convey to Harold that Bob, her and their family were all okay.
There are many emails related to a show I didn’t know about previously scheduled for October 2001 in Paderborn, Germany — Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum. I don’t see this listed in the bio and never heard Harold mention this show to me. Harold was to go to the opening but was unable due to surgery to relieve a pinched nerve. The details of the show includes projecting AARON onto a very large multi-meter screen, run a looping video of Harold talking about AARON. Initially, KCAT was to be running but Harold sent an updated version. There was a lengthy discussion on printing works onsite making them available for sale. I am still reading through the emails to determine if printing onsite for purchase by museum goers actually happened or not. There was discussion of selling smaller works that could be rolled in a tube and sold for $100 a piece. There are also many emails related to the difficulties of printing quality prints.  The Museum has a link to the show at https://www.hnf.de/ausstellungen/rueckblick/kunst-aus-dem-computer.html. They claim that 7 physical works were shown. Maybe SANY0005 was one of them. I am working on reaching out to the museum. It would also be good to know if SANY005 was one of the ones show and if not what was shown and do they have any Cohen/AARON works. But it would also be good to know if they still have a runnable version of AARON.

 Hi Tom, I’m not familiar with the picture but there were a lot of them and I might have seen it but forgotten it.  The resolution is low so I can’t make out the weaving together of color groups, though I can see that it’s happening, which make me think it is probably authentic.  I’m a bit surprised at the bright rim of the pot; I don’t recall Harold doing that.  Who is the email from?  —P


Hi Paul,I have attached a snapshot of a framed print. The name of the file is SANY0005.jpg and dated September 21, 2001. I found it mixed in with emails from 2000-2002. I am assuming the SANY of the filename indicates it was from a Sanyo digital camera. Does this happen to look familiar to you? Or have any thoughts regarding this work? Tom<SANY0005 1.JPG>

Since the physical print date precedes the aa file timestamp by one year, that begs the question, ""How is this possible?"" I know you probably want a quick yes or no answer. If that is true then the quick is answer yes. Yes, meaning the physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file timestamp is 2003. But this would certainly suggest an error. Did Tom write down the information incorrectly? Is that the error? No. The timestamp for the aa file is 2003 and the signed print is 2002. 

It seems like we have one of two scenarios. One, Harold signed the physical print incorrectly.  Two, he signed the print correctly. But, we don't know why the generated work seems to be in the future. If the second scenario is true, how could it be true? Maybe, the version of AARON Harold used was from 2002 and that he simply ran it in 2003. 

We had a situation at the Whitney this past year whereby all the work was generated in 2023 and then plotted in 2024. However, the version of AARON generating the work was from 2001. We may think these are 2024 works because they were plotted in 2024. But maybe in the mind of the artist they are really 2001 works because all the works were already fixed as potentials in the 2001.

I'm not sure if the second scenario can be confirmed or not as I never thought about this before. When I go to the studio Tuesday, I will see what I can find. I also sent a message to Cohen's 2002-2003 assistant and waiting for her thoughts and this matter.

I am sorry to hear George is no longer with Gazelli. He will be missed. I certainly wish him well and hope our paths cross again. This news does not surprise me. Gazelli has been awfully quiet as of late and was a bit concerned. Also because there is much uncertainty in the society at large and I kinda thought Dallas would be a litmus test of sorts reflecting how much people are being affected by all the uncertainty. And I guess they responded in a clear uniform manner. 
We still haven’t shipped any of the work we talked about back in December. I rather think its okay at this point to put it all back now and wait for a more favorable change in the wind. Since the pulled work takes up much space, I have been moving forward with documenting the digital inventory of AARON images we have starting from 1995 with a focus on translating the previously unviewable AARON vector script files. But I would like to put the pulled work back into the racks and so I can finish inventorying the physical work in Kanoko’s room. 
I would also like at some point to purchase a Windows machine with the intent to set it up as a dedicated machine whose sole function would be to run all the various code we have. I tried setting up some Virtual Machines on the new Macbook but since the Macbook has an Apple M2 processor it won’t run any Intel x86 processor operating systems like Red Hat and Windows. 
Last week I finished compiling and running all the 2007 code we have. That means I have checked all the code from 2007 to 2016. For a total of 116 version tested. Not all of them run of course. We don’t have any source code from 2006. I would like at some point to start working on 2005. I did try to compile a few of the 2005 AARON versions but apparently the was a big change in Allegro’s compiler between 2005 and 2007 and we don’t have their 2005 compiler. Some of the 2005 ones it compile with a large number of warnings complaining that I don’t have the right compile. In any case, they don't run. I did however find passwords for early versions of Allegro but have not found any earlier compilers yet. 
I also started looking at the earliest code we have from the 1995/96s. Most of it seems to be standard Common Lisp so maybe some or it can be compiled by the Allegro we have. I do know that some of the code is cut off so I doubt any one version is complete. We may have to use code from other versions and/or make some assumptions to get the oldest ones running.  Unfortunately for these 1990s versions we don’t have any make files and not descriptor files saying how to make AARON from that time. That can be overcome I am sure. 
Based on your call with Mila, what do you think regarding the shipment? George seems to have been the one spearheading the list. With him out of the picture, shall we hold off until the winds change toward a more favorable direction? If so, I am ok with that.
Tom

Hi Tom - great to connect, if you have time in the coming weeks I would
love to schedule a call to get your insights on Harold and his work,
they'll no doubt be invaluable as we flesh out the narrative for the
documentary. I know it's a busy time of the year so no immediate rush on my
side, happy to do in the new year if that suits you better.

Best,
Joel

This list is a work in progress and not complete. I ran into a problem with some of the portrait paintings dates. I am not sure why but some of them have the wrong dates so I am reviewing all of them. I did notice some other inconsistancies in the artlogic document compared to the original notes sometime ago but have not done a comprehensive review as of yet. In any case, I am plugging away at creating the list you can see most of it here. I need to move some items around to access some additional works which may be approximately 4 more items. Currently there are 54 items to be shipped. That is quite of few and I want to make sure everything it correct so I appreciate your patience as it will take a bit longer to complete. I do have most of the measurements that were not in the original artlogic doc George sent and hope to have all the measurements by Thursday or at least an estimated measurement as I suspect the measurements are important to the shipper.

I put together a catalog of digital works for the year 2000. In the process, I translated the 13 previously unviewable AARON composition. First into SVG and then converted it them to jpegs. Some of the 13 were file fragments. Even so, both complete files and fragments are in included in the catalog. I also included all of the screenshots and other digital files I could find in our archives. The catalog also has background information and other details I know regarding the 2000 works. You can view it here. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nYuHGWIfbPW9dlNVppT6yCs2_HPH3zNcZS2tuTcPrec/edit?usp=sharing
We have a pile of undated printouts. This catalog gives a clear idea which styles belong to 2000. And thus, will be help a in identifying those works. I plan on doing the same for year 2001. Starting in 2002, Harold began to save the AARON composition in multiple formats including jpegs. So we already there is a good idea of what was produced in 2002. But 2001 is still somewhat vague. And like 2000, 2001 has many unviewable AARON composition files. Files that need translating. 
I have been doing a similar catalog for the entire 1990s with the focus on all the intangible works from that decade. Intangible meaning the handful of digital files we have plus all the 35mm screenshots. This is a work in progress but can be viewed herehttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pyeO-NdrtvDaauQaAznAQK-WWs-K5b6BgoHuIQAutY4/edit?usp=sharing

I got the following email from Nina  Karavasiles former HC assistantTom,Yesterday I was speaking to Brett Stalbaum. He is a professor at UC that Harold helped to get in (I think). He had mentioned that the faculty wanted to have a showing of Harold's work at the UC gallery, but couldn't afford it. I said I would ask you if it was possible to have a show with a lesser cost, not through the museum.If this is a question for Paul, please give me his email or phone contact.
I know there was talk before about put the Whitney show on the road. I there is interest from our side be in Whitney style or something else I can do some preliminary reach out. Let me know your thoughts. 
I am waiting for an insurance document from Gazelli so we can look at it before taking the next step for the shipment. I haven’t heard from Micheal. If I don’t hear from him in the morning, I will reach out to him.

This invoice includes $215.47 for a couple of drives I used to backup what could be backed up. Also since this is the last invoice 2024, I included the summary in a separate file. 

Seems like Gazelli is shutdown for the remaining of the year. Hopefully shortly after they return will finish hammering out the list of items to be shipped and then ship them the items. 

I reached out to Roger (our printer) regarding paying him and waiting a reply. I reviewed the work he did again and it really quite good.
I know you want to submit a potential list of code for the Whitney and with our last conversion we talked about what criteria the Whitney would be looking for. I have been thinking about what they have and what they don't have. They have KCAT and Gijon. 

Here are the main AASC groupings we have and where KCAT and Gijon belong
Group-A. 2013 - 2016 Fingerpainting EraGroup-B. 2009 - 2013 Collaborating with my other SelfGroup-C. 2007 - 2009 Gijon belongs hereGroup-D. 2000 - 2005 KCAT belongs hereGroup-E. 1995 - 1997 Painting Machine EraGroup-F.  1992 - 1995 Early LISP fragments 
Group-G  Paper Code various dates
Group-H  Film Code various dates

Of the main groups, the Whitney already has code representing Group-C and -D. That leaves Group-A, -B, & -E thru -H
 Group-A. 2013 - 2016 Fingerpainting Era
I have a collection of videos for Group-A Fingerpainting Era of the code running. There are 8 runnable versions. They all look similar in that they all make black and white drawings. They are all studio versions meaning they all generate AARON artwork intended for use in the studio and for the Fingerpainting Machine. The files it generates are in non-standard viewable file format. They are readable by the Fingerpainting Machine.

Apologies for the late response.
Sending you the signed contract, where it does not specify the uniqueness
of the work.
Let me speak to Michael again given the information Tom sent through in the

be more harmful for our relationship with Sotheby's which we want to keep

Thank you for contacting the BBC Archives.

I can tell you that the material described in your documents relates to two different programmes, one TV and one radio.

The TV programme was called “Sunday Night: Five for Venice”, this was shown on BBC1 on 25 September 1966. Unfortunately this programme no longer exists in the BBC Archives.

The other programme was broadcast in a series called “Some American Artists” on 20 March 1967 on BBC radio (Network Three, one of the forerunners of Radio 3), although it looks like it was probably recorded two years earlier as per your information. This programme does exist in the BBC Archives.

Apart from this item, we also have some later programmes which feature Harold Cohen, which we can give you details of if required.

We may be able to give you access to these existing programmes to view or listen to for research purposes, if you are looking to use them beyond that we would need details of what use you proposed to make of them, and we can advise what may be possible based on that.

The imagery generated is unique. The print is 1 of x and there was a 2 of x and 3 of x in some cases. So there maybe x of x instances of this uniqueness. Each work AARON generates is certainly unique in that AARON by Cohen's coded design does not generate the same work more once. It is unique in that it is signed 1 of x whereas no other print is signed 1 of x. The series is special in that we have never sold the digital image let alone the digital + print together. I'm not sure if including AARON in the text is appropriate but like I mentioned Harold's coded design of AARON assures us that AARON did not and cannot generate the same likeness of this same image even we ran it billions of times it would not generate this image again. The wording is a bit tricky because we may another print produced in his lifetime but it is certainly not signed as 1 of x. 
I am not in a disagreement of the use of unique as that is an inherent feature if AARON. I would like a slightly different wording with ""only known"" as all of our picks were chosen specifically because they were not the only known one. I do agree with the uniqueness use I am just not sure how to resolve the conflicting message in such a short sentence. But I will think about it.

When I wrote you initially, we had a preliminary discussion with them and brought the idea of plotting. Based on our discussion it was determined plots would have to be vertical. I have since visited the airport and I’ve seen the various viewing areas. I now have my doubts as to having live plotting in that environment. The viewing areas have these large glass cases mounted on the wall. But the depth is only 8 inches. So that was the purpose of the inquiry. Glad to know there is the potential for Giant wall mounted plotters. In a correspondence Harold wrote in the early 1970s, he conveys his vision of a wall mounted machine making art. Hopefully at some point we can make that a reality. I thought maybe this upcoming exhibit would be the place for it. I rather think it will have to be at another time and another place.
I do love your prototype. Thanks for the photo. We also received your publication. I’m enjoying the entire read. Thanks for all you did regarding Harold Cohen.

We have a prototype that can do a 24x72"" plot on 28x76"" paper. Giant and wall mounted plotters are possible, but the effort and expense are non trivial.
Happy to chat more about ideas if you like. Do you have a project in mind?

Hi Bre,

Hope you are well.  Hoping to get some preliminary background on the possibility of an idea Paul mentioned.  How close to a mural-size work do you think your plotters could plot? Is 48 or 60 inch wide paper a possibility? Is even larger, say 8 or 10 ft possible? And instead having a person manually mount each sheet like at the Whitney, is it possible to have a roll of paper? Like, say a 60” x 100 foot roll or 48” x 350 ft? Or multiple rolls? And plot maybe a 60x48inch area at a time. And then advance the roll for the next plot? Or could it somehow plot an area, whatever size that maybe, and then, move to another area and plot that other area. And move about across whatever space is available to complete the work? And maybe more importantly than the size… could all of this be done vertically? This may be a bit ambitious, but in a sense, I am asking how close do you think you could get to making a vertical turtle that would execute multiple murals and do so with minimal human intervention. And however close that might be, what would that look like?"

Regarding NFT Collector's enquiry, I am currently piecing together the source code history. But currently I only have a rudimentary outline and information. I do have additional details but probably not necessarily pertinent. Of course if the collector has specific questions we can address those one by one. 

But as a general response,

The main groups (which are subject to change) are:(1995 to 2006) People+Plants to Plants with No People
(2007 to 2009) Plants to No Gravity(2009 to 2013) No Gravity to No Backgrounds(2013 to 2016) Fingerpainting
The works in the show belong to the first group (1995 to 2006) People+Plants to Plants with No People.The area of focus for the show was 2002-2003 with 2003 being the main focus. 2003 is important because the 20 year effort to include people breathed its last breath that year so too did the table along with a cube, bowls, vases, bottles and goblets. The last iteration that included these elements also included shadows cast on the table. It is the shadow feature that Harold carried forward and let the others ones go. The shadow element is important for over time it morphs and he transformed its function. Another element he continued with was the potted plant. However, the pots are not necessarily always visible sometimes they are out of the frame and or there existence only implied. He seems to have a couple trains of thought at that time. One is to continue to include the pot and showcase that it is still in a room with or without tiles and/or shadows.  The another was to focus on the foliage in the upper canopy along with stems and branches. It took time but ultimately the latter won out. 

As for technical details. We have currently do not have any AARON versions from 2002 or 2003 that run. We do have saved source code versions from 2002 and 2003 though. And based on dates of the files in the source we can guess which version was used to generate the works that are in the show. Depending on which work we are referring to it could have been aaron5, aaron6 or aaron7. Of course, ideally we get these versions running and see what AARON was actually generated to be absolutely sure. 

The 2002/2003 code was written in Lisp on a Windows based machine most likely running Windows 2000 but I don't have enough information to confirm this. It might have been Windows XP Professional-64. I can however, say that AARON was compiled with Franz Allegro and most likely compiled with version acl62w. He would have run the program from within the Allegro integrated environment as he rarely made executable versions. The executable versions were typically only made for exhibitions and unfortunately we do not have a known executable ones from this time period. Because we do not have any known executables we can't say how big the program was. However, I did look at one of the aaron6 versions. It consisted of 1.1MB of typed code in 79 source code files. Unfortunately, Harold rarely used comments so this 1.1MB is almost all hand typed Lisp source code. Because we no longer have the computer that he used to created the works shown at the show, we can't say for sure how long it took AARON to generated a particular image but it is believed to have been 1 to 7 minutes or so depending on complexity. 

As for notebooks, Harold seemed to have stopped using paper notebooks on a regular basis sometime in the 1990s which is prior to these works. However, Harold did continue to write for publications. I don't see any written in 2003 but the following two were written in 2002.
Leonardo: Journal of the International
Society for the Arts,Sciences and
Technology (Volume 35, No. 1, 2002)
Here is a link to another 2002 publication which links to our website. Although it is written in 2002, starting on page 29 he does dive into some details that maybe be of interest
https://aaronshome.com/aaron/publications/changingworld.doc
On Monday, I will look to see if we have any additional computer note files from 2003 in our archives.

2 works have now been sold with another 3 being considered. Once the physical exhibition is over on Tuesday, the sale will continue online. 
There was an enquiry from one of the top NFT collectors re the actual program producing these (some technical questions). Is there anything we can share in addition to what has already been communicated ? Perhaps some images of Harold’s sketchbook or anything you might think would be relevant.

I’d like to call attention to the Gazelli shipment. The attached the Dietl shipper is still a matter of concern. You may recall that back in January we expressed our concerns to Gazelli because of their terms. I went back to Gazelli and asked for proof of insurance. Gazelli has since provided proof of insurance fro Lloyd’s of London. However, when I went back and reread Dietl's terms, I am still uncomfortable with them.  

The way I read the terms, it seems to say that there is absolutely no insurance unless it is specifically requested ahead of time AND pay both the invoice for their services and the additional insurance fees, and that they won’t honor any insurance claims unless that is done. This makes it seem as though, if we rely on our own insurance instead of buying theirs and there is damage or a problem, they won’t honor the claim or help our insurance company in any way (like providing information to support the claim.) 

I am also quite concerned with their wording with respect to the workers being onsite in the studio. If there are no problems then none of this matters. If we could be 100% sure there would be absolutely no issues then we would need any insurance. I would not be surprised if their wording was constructed in this way because of their past experience. If so, then this is an additional red flag. Even with the insurance from Lloyd's of London, I am still uncomfortable with Deitl terms. Seems like a can of worms potentially exploding into venomous snakes. 

If you see otherwise, please let me know."

Hope all is well!
Excellent time we have spent with Paul this week and very productive.
George is due to write a note to you shortly too.

A quick request from the Spalters -

A museum in France, Jeu de Paume <https://jeudepaume.org/en/about-us/>, is
asking for the reproduction of some pages from Harold Cohen's drawing book
to include in their forthcoming publication as illustrations for a ""time
capsule"" entitled ""Generative art"", that draws connections between the
current developments of AI and earlier artistic endeavours.

If you agree, we would need to send HD files for print along with complete
captions , credits and copyrights to mention to them.

Let us know?

My best,
Mila"

 Tom,
Thanks for your time earlier.  Per discussion we will go with:
1) the Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery2) Use Harold Cohen Trust instead of HCT3) We will use the file sizes as per the files themselves and not the file size in the Word Document you previously provided.

Thanks for clarifying - we will pass this on to Sotheby’s.

Hi Thomas,
Thanks so much for the additional information you provided yesterday.  We wanted to run a few changes by you which have been picked up by our team.

 - We noticed that the Birdie Taylor gallery is referred to online as the Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery online - should we go with this version? ie.  Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery
 - We suggest using Harold Cohen Trust instead as HCT as believe this is clearer.  Are you OK with this?
 - Should we change paper to Roland PQM-CRBW-33-50 paper? Or are you not sure if all prints are on this type of paper? 

 - Some of the file sizes are slightly different to what you wrote when we double checked them on our end.  See below for more information.  Are you OK with these changes?

This is a list of material we have in the archive relating to Harold Cohen:

Newsnight tx 07/06/83 – item on Computer Art
It’ll Never Work tx 10/12/96 – children’s science series, there is an item in this edition on an AI program which made paintings
Knowledge Talks: The Turing Test tx 21/09/01
Open University: Artware: Computers in the Arts tx 29/04/97 – I’m not 100% sure we have access to this programme.

As you can see, there is not a great deal of content. I have not been able to find any more radio material other than the recording for the series “Some American Artists”.

Kind regards

Dear Andrew,
Much thanks for looking into our requests and for the quick response. Sorry for my delayed response as I was following up on another lead regarding the Director of Sunday Night: Five for Venice.

I understand the ""Sunday Night: Five for Venice"" is no longer extant in your archives. I have since found some additional information which confirms what you wrote but also hope that maybe a copy still is extant. I understand the late Ann Turner (1927-2018) was the film director of the programme. In a voice recorded interviewed by Alan Lawson in 1995 she provides the details on the films demise where she says*(see note below), ""BBC One, I had a five for Venice on the 25th of October in 1966. I'd spent a year following around the British Council something we could never do these days. Actually, with the five artists concern, which are known as Tony Cairo, Danny Cairo, Robin Denny now CBE, the two Cohen's Harold and Bernard and Dick Smith and Lillian Somerville, Sir Herbert Read. David Thompson was involved as the catalogue was his. And I think it's a very interesting film. And I would very much like to see it except BBC lent it to Nancy for ?OU? thing. Humphrey had not signed the retention order. And the thing was junked with its negative when it came back to film library, Alan Hanson nearly went through the roof, because you know all those artists are important. And they were all in their studios talking about their work.""

That is a pity. But Ann Turner goes on to say later in the interview,""One of the things I have not followed up is if whether the British Council, I may simply have given them a copy with luck, they might have kept it you know."" Do you have any thoughts on how I would approach the British Council to ask if they have a copy?

Also regarding the other finds. This is wonderful news. What do we need to do to get a listing of sorts from you?"
