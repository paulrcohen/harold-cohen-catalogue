-serif;font-size:16px"><div dir=3D"ltr">Dear BBC Archivist,</div><div dir=
=3D"ltr">My name is Thomas Machnik and I am the Art Studio Manager for the =
Harold Cohen Trust. Harold Cohen (1928-2016) was a prominent British artist=
 both as a painter and then later developed AARON -- AI computer based art.=
 I am currently doing research for the Trust. Based on the Trust archives, =
we know Cohen appeared on BBC TV and radio. We are trying to determine if t=
hese appearances are still extant. What type of information would you need =
in order to determine if you have any film or audio? In some cases we only =
have a reference alluding to an interview. But we do have a couple typed up=
 documents that looks like TV transcripts. One of the transcripts has the f=
ollowing details:</div><div dir=3D"ltr">BARNET NEWMAN talking to David Sylv=
ester</div><div dir=3D"ltr">Producer: Leonie Cohn</div><div dir=3D"ltr">Tra=
nsmission: Wednesday 17th November 1965: 2140-2215</div><div dir=3D"ltr">Ta=
pe No: CTAM 42905</div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br></div><div dir=3D"ltr">This tra=
nscript is 13 pages and it has a second transcript titled, &quot;INTRODUCTI=
ON TO BARNETT NEWMAN INTERVIEW WITH DAVID SYLVESTER by John Richardson&quot=
; and says the length is 7&#39;10&quot;</div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br></div><di=
v dir=3D"ltr">Based on reading the transcripts the show is primarily about =
Newman. But on page 4 of the second transcript=C2=A0 it reads, &quot;As Har=
old Cohen is going to discuss the nature of Newman&#39;s impact on himself =
and others later in the programme, I will say no more than that.&quot;</div=
><div dir=3D"ltr"><br></div><div dir=3D"ltr">These two transcripts are the =
same folder so we assume they go together even though the John Richardson t=
ranscript portion does not have any of the details like time date or tape n=
umber. In this same folder we do not have any transcript of Harold Cohen sp=
eaking. But we do have a separate folder with a TV transcript and wonder if=
 this TV transcript belongs with the above or with a separate transmission.=
 The Harold Cohen transcript has a column that includes camera directions. =
For example it starts off like this:</div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br></div><div d=
ir=3D"ltr">130/2 Top shot</div><div dir=3D"ltr">from ladder</div><div dir=
=3D"ltr">---------------</div><div dir=3D"ltr">H.C. unrolls canvas</div><di=
v dir=3D"ltr"><br></div><div dir=3D"ltr">Then on the 4 page it has a header=
 that reads:</div><div dir=3D"ltr">ROLL ONE: SUNDAY NIGHT: PROJECT NO. 5616=
/0109</div><div dir=3D"ltr">LOCATION - N.LONDON</div><div dir=3D"ltr">-----=
-------------------------------------------------------------</div><div dir=
=3D"ltr">The people talking are only referred to by initials. The intiials =
are primarily HC, DT. But on ROLL TWO we see A.T. Question and HC, then on =
ROLL SIX (we don&#39;t have ROLLS 3-5) we see LS, HC, HR, AG.</div><div dir=
=3D"ltr"><br></div><div dir=3D"ltr">If the Tape NO CTAM 42905 really was tr=
ansmitted Nov 17, 1965, I rather think this PROJECT NO 5616/0109 might be b=
it later as there is much discussion about the British Pavillion at the <sp=
an>Venice Bienalle XXIII 1966. Much of the transcript refers to artwork tha=
t will be rolled up and sent to the Bienalle. I believe the show opened Jun=
e 1966. So this interview would be sometime in Spring 1966 I image.<br></sp=
an></div><div dir=3D"ltr"><span><br></span></div><div dir=3D"ltr"><span>We =
do have a typed document in a separate folder with a document inside titled=
 &quot;BARNETT NEWMAN by Harold Cohen&quot;. It does not have the same look=
 as a TV transcript but maybe a draft for the 1965 TV show. This work is no=
t dated but it begins like this, &quot;In his interview with David Sylveste=
r, Newman gives a very full and really very technical account of the way hi=
s painting developed....&quot; Though it is not dated we suspect it belongs=
 to CTAM 42905 tape. And that PROJECT NO 5616/0109 is separate TV transmiss=
ion. In any case, we are hoping to resolve these unknowns with your help.<b=

r at a minimum determine what is still extant. I provided the above as it i=

re some of his other events were also filmed by the BBC. What type of infor=
mation would you need to help us determine what is still extant? If you cou=
