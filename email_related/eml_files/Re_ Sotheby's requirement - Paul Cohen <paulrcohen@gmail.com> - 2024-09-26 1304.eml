Ok, so my understanding is that we cannot assure Sotheby's that the 9 works
are unique, hence we cannot have the auction.  I hold Sotheby's responsible
for this, unless they gave us a contract earlier that specifies that
uniqueness is a requirement and defines uniqueness.  We've worked pretty
hard as they have moved the goalposts, but this is one move too far, too
late.
