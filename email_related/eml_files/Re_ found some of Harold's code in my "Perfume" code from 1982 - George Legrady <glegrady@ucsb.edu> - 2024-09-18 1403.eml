Hi Paul,=20

The code which I will scan this week-end and send to you is simple - it =
visualizes how a set of particles leave the contained space of a bottle =
to fill the large space around it. What is relevant to you is that I am =
using Harold=E2=80=99s environment of how the software data is =
visualized on the Tecktronix, so you get to have the code for the =
interface.=20

=E2=80=94

Background: I arrived in San Digeo in August 1981, and was staying by =
chance with a grad student, Jeff Greenberg, who turned out to be =
Harold=E2=80=99s assistant. I saw a =E2=80=9CBYTE=E2=80=9D magazine in =
the corner of the room, and told him about my interest in getting to =
know about computers. Jeff took me to Harold=E2=80=99s studio and =
introduced me. It was a Friday afternoon. After about 5 minutes=E2=80=99 =
conversation, Harold said, come by Monday and we will get you a key to =
the studio. Harold knew I was an artist as I think Jeff had shown Harold =
my two-page photographic spread titled =E2=80=9CArtificial =
Intelligence=E2=80=9D in Parachute magazine, an art theory journal from =
Montreal.

I had access to Harold=E2=80=99s studio and equipment for about 3 years, =
while teaching photography at Cal Arts. That is how I learned computing, =
working at his PD-11 and later VAX mainframe whenever I was not in the =
way. There were 3 or 4 terminals so we each had our personal station. I =
got Kernigan=E2=80=99s and Ritchie=E2=80=99s book on C language and =
learned on my own with Jeff helping me out here and there. Harold never =
asked anything from me, and I consider his generous offer to his =
computer invaluable as there was no access to computers unless one was =
afiliated with academia, industry or the military. It was on Harold=E2=80=99=
s system that I was able to transition from the analog world of =
photography to the computational world. Nonetheless I had to wait until =
1986 to be able to do =E2=80=9Cdigital photography=E2=80=9D when the =
AT&T Targa Truevision system became available. There is an early image =
from that series in the =E2=80=9CDigital Witness=E2=80=9D exh. at LACMA.=20=
