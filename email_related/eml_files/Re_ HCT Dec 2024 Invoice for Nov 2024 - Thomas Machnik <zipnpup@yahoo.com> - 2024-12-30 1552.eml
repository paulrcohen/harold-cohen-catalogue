 Hi Paul,I know you are probably busy with holidays and such therefore I ha=

 Hi PaulPlease find attached my invoice for Nov 2024 work. This invoice inc=
ludes $215.47 for a couple of drives I used to backup what could be backed =
up. Also since this is the last invoice 2024, I included the summary in a s=
eparate file.=20

Seems like Gazelli is shutdown for the remaining of the year. Hopefully sho=
rtly after they return will finish hammering out the list of items to be sh=
ipped and then ship them the items.=20

I reached out to Roger (our printer) regarding paying him and waiting a rep=
ly. I reviewed the work he did again and it really quite good.
I know you want to submit a potential list of code for the Whitney and with=
 our last conversion we talked about what criteria the Whitney would be loo=
king for. I have been thinking about what they have and what they don't hav=
e. They have KCAT and Gijon.=20


Here are the main AASC groupings we have and where KCAT and Gijon belong
Group-A. 2013 - 2016 Fingerpainting EraGroup-B. 2009 - 2013 Collaborating w=
ith my other SelfGroup-C. 2007 - 2009 Gijon belongs hereGroup-D. 2000 - 200=
5 KCAT belongs hereGroup-E. 1995 - 1997 Painting Machine EraGroup-F.=C2=A0 =
1992 - 1995 Early LISP fragments=20
Group-G=C2=A0 Paper Code various dates
Group-H=C2=A0 Film Code various dates

Of the main groups, the Whitney already has code representing Group-C and -=
D. That leaves Group-A, -B, & -E thru -H
 Group-A. 2013 - 2016 Fingerpainting Era
I have a collection of videos for Group-A Fingerpainting Era of the code ru=
nning. There are 8 runnable versions. They all look similar in that they al=
l make black and white drawings. They are all studio versions meaning they =
all generate AARON artwork intended for use in the studio and for the Finge=
rpainting Machine. The files it generates are in non-standard viewable file=
 format. They are readable by the Fingerpainting Machine.

 Group-B. 2009 - 2013 Collaborating with my other Self
The later code in this time period is similar to Group-A in that they produ=
ce black and white drawings. Unlike Group-A though, Group-B does make stand=
ard viewable file format artwork files. There is one exhibition version cal=
led London (full version name 20130710-1259 aaron.london.13) that represent=
s this late time period. The early time period of Group-B can be represente=
d by "Collaborating with my other Self-2011, "Utah-2012" there should also =
be the "AARON's Floating World" which was shown at Carnegie Science Center =
in 2009 but I am unable to verify that at the moment. These early works dis=
play colorful overlapping shapes and overtime changes background color. Als=
o in this group is the sub-group -- Cox. Cox is a group of AARON versions t=
hat generated free hanging sculptures. We don't have any exhibition version=
s of Cox. They make files for making sculptures. Cox represents the transit=
ion to "Collaborating with my other Self"

 Group-E. 1995 - 1997 Painting Machine Era
This group spans the Painting Machine Era and is the code that George Blood=
 recovered. These are the oldest recovered full versions of AARON we curren=
tly have from digital media. I say full versions but in actuality we curren=
tly don't have a way to verify this. I have looked at the tape output and t=
he file names are similar to the next generation of file names, so, I am ho=
pefully that at least a couple of the versions we have from the tapes are f=
ully intact.=20

 Group-F.=C2=A0 1992 - 1995 Early LISP fragments=20
These are fragments of LISP code recovered from floppy disks. Not all are n=
ecessarily part of the main AARON code but rather possibly AARON experiment=
s of some sort. Some do, however, make reference to AARON and are some how =
related to AARON. This group represents the oldest code recovered from digi=
tal media so far.
Group-G Paper CodeThis group is any found code printed on paper -- typicall=
y computer pin-fed paper. Some were found in the notebooks others were foun=
d in manila folders. Some have been scanned and copied to the digital archi=
ve. Some have dates most do not, however, based on the context we can get a=
pproximate dates. And these dates tend to be the 1970's. One in particular =
is from code titled PIER02.SAI and is dated Oct 18, 1973 which would have b=
een up at Stanford. This one is not a full program but rather just a page.=
=20

Group-H Film CodeThere are a few film strips with snapshots of the computer=
 screen. Computer screens with code on them. They are dated 1974 and seem t=
o be very early Stanford code. This is not a full program it is only a port=
ion. The ones that have been found have been scanned and added to the digit=
al archive.
I don't know if the above is a helpful summary for Whitney of what we curre=
ntly have. I hope so.=C2=A0
Happy Holidays,
Tom

 group of AARON versions that generated free hanging sculptures. We don't h=
ave any exhibition versions of Cox. They make files for making sculptures. =

a way to verify this. I have looked at the tape output and the file names a=
