Hi George, this is great news!  Congratulations!  I'd love to see the code
in any format (and I don't mind retyping it by hand -- it is a good way to
get a feel for how it works).  I've managed to avoid learning C, but now is
a good opportunity!  I don't quite understand what it does -- is this your
code that you wrote when working with HC or is it code that HC used, or a
combination?  In any case, it's super important to preserve these origins,
so I'd love to have a look.  Thanks!  --P

At Harold=E2=80=99s opening we had talked about tracking down some of Harol=
d=E2=80=99s code from the early 1980s in my storage space. Also Becky who I=
 had not seen for many decades, amazingly remembered I wrote my first progr=
am in Harold=E2=80=99s lab that visualized the operation of perfume molecul=
es leaving an enclosed contained space into a wider open space as a way to =
illustrate that time cannot proceed backwards as the molecules could not be=
 recollected and returned back into the enclosed space of the bottle. I got=
 the story from a Scientific American article and this seemed at the time t=
o be a good first coding project as a continuity to my staged studio photog=
raphy. <br>
<br>
I had forgotten about this code until Becky mentioned it at the opening thi=
s past winter, but this week-end, I inadvertendly came across a full printo=
ut in a stored box. It is dated June 17, 1982, and takes up 20 pages. <br>
<br>
Even though I wrote the code that visualizes the molecular animation, nearl=
y all of the utilities subroutines used to visualize the moving dots on the=
 TeckTronix screen as seen here on the right page was written by Harold, so=
 the full printout partially documents what part of his code was like at th=
at time. Unfortunately, the more interesting aspect of Harold=E2=80=99s cod=
e I dont have, only the utilities subroutines. Additionally, the code also =
gives the insight of how to get the data from the PDP-11 to the Tecktronix =
to visualize the program.<br>
<br>
Please let me know how you all want to access the code if it is of interest=
. I can scan all the pages and do a OCR to turn it into real code. Also how=
 do we distribute the credit given that the subroutines are Harold=E2=80=99=

 asisted by Jeff Greenberg, who was Harold=E2=80=99s studio assistant at th=
