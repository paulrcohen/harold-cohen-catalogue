Hey Tom, lots to discuss here!  We should have a call this week if
possible.  Very briefly:

   1. When I spoke with an accountant she said HCT should be a business,
   not a Trust
   2. I'm thinking about retiring from Pitt and moving to Boston (where
   Allegra and Hitch are) and focusing on the startup, HCT and writing (kee=
p
   this to yourself please)
   3. I have started the complicated accounting that will enable HCT to
   file taxes, but it's gonna take a while
   4. Last week I had a private convo with Mila (no Robert) re the
   Sotheby's process.  I said I was ready to pull the plug and postpone -- =
for
   reasons you have stated -- but she called Michael at Sotheby's and assur=
ed
   herself that this would likely be a sell out sale and the first of a
   series.  So I agreed to go ahead.  But in today's weekly catchup we had =
a
   hotwash and agreed that the process was out of control and needs to be
   better next time.
   5. We decided to make lists this week and prioritize at next Monday's
   catchup, so I want to talk with you about everything that needs doing
   6. All of which is pushing me to form a company so that you can be a
   full-time employee, not an hourly person, if that's what you want.  You
   have been extremely patient.  It's going to take a bit longer, mostly
   because of the accounting, but it needs to happen.  Goodness knows how I
   will sell it to the heirs, so for the time being, don't say nuthin to
   nobody!
   7. In the meantime, please bill the Trust at $50/hr.

When are you free for a catchup this week?

--P
