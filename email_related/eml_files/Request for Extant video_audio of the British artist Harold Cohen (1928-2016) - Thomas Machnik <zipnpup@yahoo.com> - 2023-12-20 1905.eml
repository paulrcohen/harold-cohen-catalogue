Dear BBC Archivist,My name is Thomas Machnik and I am the Art Studio Manage=
r for the Harold Cohen Trust. Harold Cohen (1928-2016) was a prominent Brit=
ish artist both as a painter and then later developed AARON -- AI computer =
based art. I am currently doing research for the Trust. Based on the Trust =
archives, we know Cohen appeared on BBC TV and radio. We are trying to dete=
rmine if these appearances are still extant. What type of information would=
 you need in order to determine if you have any film or audio? In some case=
s we only have a reference alluding to an interview. But we do have a coupl=
e typed up documents that looks like TV transcripts. One of the transcripts=
 has the following details:BARNET NEWMAN talking to David SylvesterProducer=
: Leonie CohnTransmission: Wednesday 17th November 1965: 2140-2215Tape No: =
CTAM 42905
This transcript is 13 pages and it has a second transcript titled, "INTRODU=
CTION TO BARNETT NEWMAN INTERVIEW WITH DAVID SYLVESTER by John Richardson" =
and says the length is 7'10"
Based on reading the transcripts the show is primarily about Newman. But on=
 page 4 of the second transcript=C2=A0 it reads, "As Harold Cohen is going =
to discuss the nature of Newman's impact on himself and others later in the=
 programme, I will say no more than that."
These two transcripts are the same folder so we assume they go together eve=
n though the John Richardson transcript portion does not have any of the de=
tails like time date or tape number. In this same folder we do not have any=
 transcript of Harold Cohen speaking. But we do have a separate folder with=
 a TV transcript and wonder if this TV transcript belongs with the above or=
 with a separate transmission. The Harold Cohen transcript has a column tha=
t includes camera directions. For example it starts off like this:
130/2 Top shotfrom ladder---------------H.C. unrolls canvas
Then on the 4 page it has a header that reads:ROLL ONE: SUNDAY NIGHT: PROJE=
CT NO. 5616/0109LOCATION - N.LONDON----------------------------------------=
--------------------------The people talking are only referred to by initia=
ls. The intiials are primarily HC, DT. But on ROLL TWO we see A.T. Question=
 and HC, then on ROLL SIX (we don't have ROLLS 3-5) we see LS, HC, HR, AG.
If the Tape NO CTAM 42905 really was transmitted Nov 17, 1965, I rather thi=
nk this PROJECT NO 5616/0109 might be bit later as there is much discussion=
 about the British Pavillion at the Venice Bienalle XXIII 1966. Much of the=
 transcript refers to artwork that will be rolled up and sent to the Bienal=
le. I believe the show opened June 1966. So this interview would be sometim=
e in Spring 1966 I image.

We do have a typed document in a separate folder with a document inside tit=
led "BARNETT NEWMAN by Harold Cohen". It does not have the same look as a T=
V transcript but maybe a draft for the 1965 TV show. This work is not dated=
 but it begins like this, "In his interview with David Sylvester, Newman gi=
ves a very full and really very technical account of the way his painting d=
eveloped...." Though it is not dated we suspect it belongs to CTAM 42905 ta=
pe. And that PROJECT NO 5616/0109 is separate TV transmission. In any case,=
 we are hoping to resolve these unknowns with your help.
=20
Ultimately, we would like to view any video the BBC may have of Cohen or at=
 a minimum determine what is still extant. I provided the above as it is th=
e most detail we have pointing to a specific recording. We are quite sure s=
ome of his other events were also filmed by the BBC. What type of informati=
on would you need to help us determine what is still extant? If you could a=
dvise me further on how to proceed, that would be most appreciated.
