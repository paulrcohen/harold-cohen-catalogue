 Hi Paul,Thanks for the update. I am sorry to hear George is no longer with=
 Gazelli. He will be missed. I certainly wish him well and hope our paths c=
ross again. This news does not surprise me. Gazelli has been awfully quiet =
as of late and was a bit concerned. Also because there is much uncertainty =
in the society at large and I kinda thought Dallas would be a litmus test o=
f sorts reflecting how much people are being affected by all the uncertaint=
y. And I guess they responded in a clear uniform manner.=C2=A0
We still haven=E2=80=99t shipped any of the work we talked about back in De=
cember. I rather think its okay at this point to put it all back now and wa=
it for a more favorable change in the wind. Since the pulled work takes up =
much space, I have been moving forward with documenting the digital invento=
ry of AARON images we have starting from 1995 with a focus on translating t=
he previously unviewable AARON vector script files. But I would like to put=
 the pulled work back into the racks and so I can finish inventorying the p=
hysical work in Kanoko=E2=80=99s room.=C2=A0
I would also like at some point to purchase a Windows machine with the inte=
nt to set it up as a dedicated machine whose sole function would be to run =
all the various code we have. I tried setting up some Virtual Machines on t=
he new Macbook but since the Macbook has an Apple M2 processor it won=E2=80=
=99t run any Intel x86 processor operating systems like Red Hat and Windows=
.=C2=A0
Last week I finished compiling and running all the 2007 code we have. That =
means I have checked all the code from 2007 to 2016. For a total of 116 ver=
sion tested. Not all of them run of course. We don=E2=80=99t have any sourc=
e code from 2006. I would like at some point to start working on 2005. I di=
d try to compile a few of the 2005 AARON versions but apparently the was a =
big change in Allegro=E2=80=99s compiler between 2005 and 2007 and we don=
=E2=80=99t have their 2005 compiler. Some of the 2005 ones it compile with =
a large number of warnings complaining that I don=E2=80=99t have the right =
compile. In any case, they don't run. I did however find passwords for earl=
y versions of Allegro but have not found any earlier compilers yet.=C2=A0
I also started looking at the earliest code we have from the 1995/96s. Most=
 of it seems to be standard Common Lisp so maybe some or it can be compiled=
 by the Allegro we have. I do know that some of the code is cut off so I do=
ubt any one version is complete. We may have to use code from other version=
s and/or make some assumptions to get the oldest ones running. =C2=A0Unfort=
unately for these 1990s versions we don=E2=80=99t have any make files and n=
ot descriptor files saying how to make AARON from that time. That can be ov=
ercome I am sure.=C2=A0
Based on your call with Mila, what do you think regarding the shipment? Geo=
rge seems to have been the one spearheading the list. With him out of the p=
icture, shall we hold off until the winds change toward a more favorable di=
rection? If so, I am ok with that.
Tom
