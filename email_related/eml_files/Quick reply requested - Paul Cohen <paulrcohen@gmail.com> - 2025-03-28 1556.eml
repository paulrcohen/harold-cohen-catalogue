Hi Tom, first I must apologize for asking for a quick answer:  Can you =
have a look at=C2=A0this opportunity =
<https://schmidtsciences.smapply.io/prog/humanities_and_artificial_intelli=
gence_virtual_institute_havi_/> from the Schmidt Sciences and let me =
know whether you=E2=80=99d like to participate in something I=E2=80=99ve =
been calling the 21st Century Catalogue Raisonne.  Basically the idea is =
to use all we know about an artist =E2=80=94 the art, writing, =
exhibitions, email, lectures, correspondence, photos etc. =E2=80=94 to =
build a really thorough, organized, conversational catalogue raisonne.  =
I=E2=80=99ve started work on such a thing for Harold based on some =
earlier work on machine reading, machine learning, knowledge curation =
and other stuff.  Anthropic say they=E2=80=99re interested.  We have =
until next week to get a 3-pager done.  If they like it then we have a =
couple of months to write a proper proposal.=20

Can you let me know if you are interested and whether I can add you as a =
participant, please.  Many thanks, =E2=80=94P=
