Robert, I'm sorry it's a pain  but yes, I think our best path is the one
you suggest.

This has been a surprisingly rich learning experience (how's that for a
positive spin!) particularly this most recent issue.  It is sure to happen
again, or something similar that could cause a token to be withdrawn, so I
wonder whether there's any general method to deal with these cases.  For
example, is there any notion of a provisional NFT or does that undermine
the whole idea of NFTs.  When I buy a house, I sign one contract saying
that I intend to buy it, but this isn't the contract that formalizes
ownership. That comes later, after various inspections are passed.

--P

        <div dir=3D"ltr"><div>Dear Robert,<br clear=3D"none">I looked into =
the matter and the short answer is still the same -- the digital files are =
timestamped 2003 and the print is signed 2002. I did not find any evidence =
to support the idea that the files were some how generated in 2002 instead =
of 2003. I came to this conclusion by examining the all the digital &amp; p=
hysical works from the beginning of 2002 to the end 2003 in chronological o=
rder. Ideally I would lay out a visual timeline so we can see the progressi=
on of AARON&#39;s development over that time. That will take quite a bit of=
 time to put together so I will leave that to a future date. But I did note=
 in my notebook the style and key elements that each of the versions of AAR=
ON produced during the 2002-03 time period. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D=
"none">By doing this, it became quite clear that AARON was not capable of p=
roducing anything in 2002 even remotely close to the plant imagery of 0311-=
32 (i23-3405) in terms of variety and complexity. The earliest it might hav=
e been able to do so would have been very late summer of 2003. Also, the wo=
rk in question (0311-32) &amp; its sister print at Sotheby&#39;s (0311-35) =
both belong to a series of works that were all generated in Oct 2003. And i=
n this series we see portrait works, square works and landscape works all w=
ith the same complexity and similar style of imagery. If we some how put 03=
11-32 in year 2002 then we have to ask well what about its sister print 031=
1-35? And what about all the other works in the series? <br clear=3D"none">=
<br clear=3D"none">In terms of AARON&#39;s early-post-painting-machine phas=
e development there is an obvious deliberate progression. The start of whic=
h seems to coincide with his purchase of a Roland HiFi printer in early 200=
0 along with a switch to Windows NT/2000 around the same time.=C2=A0 The tw=
o works at Sotheby&#39;s express the zenith in terms of AARON&#39;s early-p=
ost-painting-machine phase development. The next phase (2004+) is much diff=
erent as we can see in only 2004 work we have at Sotheby&#39;s. <br clear=
=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Of course Harold is not here to ask what happe=
ned. I rather think he signed 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002. I don&#39;t kn=
ow what the implications of this are. I hope it is like the mint minting a =
coin and making a mistake impressing the wrong year. And in turn by doing s=
