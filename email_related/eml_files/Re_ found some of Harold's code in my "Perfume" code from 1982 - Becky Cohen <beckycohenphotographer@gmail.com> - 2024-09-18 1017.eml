Dear George,  That's wonderful news!  It would be so enjoyable to see your
perfume program revived in some sort of real time expression, if ever that
strikes your fancy.  I remember being enchanted by your description of what
you were doing and, I think, some drawings you might have generated.

I'm sure that Paul, Christiane, and Tom will all be excited by your
rediscovery of this code.

It was so very nice seeing you again earlier this year for Harold's opening
at The Whitney after all these years.

Becky
