he matter and the short answer is still the same -- the digital files are ti=
mestamped 2003 and the print is signed 2002. I did not find any evidence to s=
upport the idea that the files were some how generated in 2002 instead of 20=
03. I came to this conclusion by examining the all the digital &amp; physica=
l works from the beginning of 2002 to the end 2003 in chronological order. I=
deally I would lay out a visual timeline so we can see the progression of AA=
RON's development over that time. That will take quite a bit of time to put t=
ogether so I will leave that to a future date. But I did note in my notebook=
 the style and key elements that each of the versions of AARON produced duri=

his, it became quite clear that AARON was not capable of producing anything i=
n 2002 even remotely close to the plant imagery of 0311-32 (i23-3405) in ter=
ms of variety and complexity. The earliest it might have been able to do so w=
ould have been very late summer of 2003. Also, the work in question (0311-32=
) &amp; its sister print at Sotheby's (0311-35) both belong to a series of w=
orks that were all generated in Oct 2003. And in this series we see portrait=
 works, square works and landscape works all with the same complexity and si=
milar style of imagery. If we some how put 0311-32 in year 2002 then we have=
 to ask well what about its sister print 0311-35? And what about all the oth=
er works in the series? <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">In terms of AA=
RON's early-post-painting-machine phase development there is an obvious deli=
berate progression. The start of which seems to coincide with his purchase o=
f a Roland HiFi printer in early 2000 along with a switch to Windows NT/2000=
 around the same time.&nbsp; The two works at Sotheby's express the zenith i=
n terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase development. The next p=
hase (2004+) is much different as we can see in only 2004 work we have at So=
theby's. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Of course Harold is not here t=
o ask what happened. I rather think he signed 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002.=
 I don't know what the implications of this are. I hope it is like the mint m=
inting a coin and making a mistake impressing the wrong year. And in turn by=
 doing so created something rare and more valuable as because by adding huma=
n error this work truly is "unique."<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">To=

Hi Robert,</div><div style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><sp=
an style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">When it comes to Haro=
ld there rarely is a quick answer. Since the=20
physical print date precedes the aa file timestamp by one year, that begs th=
e=20
question, "How is this possible?"</span> I know you probably want a quick ye=
s or no answer. If that is true then the quick is answer yes. Yes, meaning t=
he physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file timestamp is 2003. But th=
is would certainly suggest an error. Did Tom write down the information inco=
rrectly? Is that the error? No. The timestamp for the aa file is 2003 and th=
e signed print is 2002. <br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=3D"ltr" style=3D"f=

ave one of two scenarios. One, Harold signed the physical print incorrectly.=
&nbsp; Two, he signed the print correctly. But, we don't know why the genera=
ted work seems to be in the future. If the second scenario is true, how coul=
d it be true? Maybe, the version of AARON Harold used was from 2002 and that=
 he simply ran it in 2003. <br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=3D"ltr" style=3D=

y this past year whereby all the work=20
was generated in 2023 and then plotted in 2024. However, the version of=20
AARON generating the work was from 2001. We may think these are 2024 works=20=

because they were plotted in 2024. But maybe in the mind of the artist=20
they are really 2001 works because all the works were already fixed as=20
