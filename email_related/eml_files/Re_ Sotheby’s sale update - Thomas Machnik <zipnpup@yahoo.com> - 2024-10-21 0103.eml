 Hi Mila,Thanks for the links to the works showing them hanging and for the=
 update. Regarding NFT Collector's enquiry, I am currently piecing together=
 the source code history. But currently I only have a rudimentary outline a=
nd information. I do have additional details but probably not necessarily p=
ertinent. Of course if the collector has specific questions we can address =
those one by one.=20

But as a general response,

The main groups (which are subject to change) are:(1995 to 2006) People+Pla=
nts to Plants with No People
(2007 to 2009) Plants to No Gravity(2009 to 2013) No Gravity to No Backgrou=
nds(2013 to 2016) Fingerpainting
The works in the show belong to the first group (1995 to 2006) People+Plant=
s to Plants with No People.The area of focus for the show was 2002-2003 wit=
h 2003 being the main focus. 2003 is important because the 20 year effort t=
o include people breathed its last breath that year so too did the table al=
ong with a cube, bowls, vases, bottles and goblets. The last iteration that=
 included these elements also included shadows cast on the table. It is the=
 shadow feature that Harold carried forward and let the others ones go. The=
 shadow element is important for over time it morphs and he transformed its=
 function. Another element he continued with was the potted plant. However,=
 the pots are not necessarily always visible sometimes they are out of the =
frame and or there existence only implied. He seems to have a couple trains=
 of thought at that time. One is to continue to include the pot and showcas=
e that it is still in a room with or without tiles and/or shadows.=C2=A0 Th=
e another was to focus on the foliage in the upper canopy along with stems =
and branches. It took time but ultimately the latter won out.=20

As for technical details. We have currently do not have any AARON versions =
from 2002 or 2003 that run. We do have saved source code versions from 2002=
 and 2003 though. And based on dates of the files in the source we can gues=
s which version was used to generate the works that are in the show. Depend=
ing on which work we are referring to it could have been aaron5, aaron6 or =
aaron7. Of course, ideally we get these versions running and see what AARON=
 was actually generated to be absolutely sure.=20

The 2002/2003 code was written in Lisp on a Windows based machine most like=
ly running Windows 2000 but I don't have enough information to confirm this=
. It might have been Windows XP Professional-64. I can however, say that AA=
RON was compiled with Franz Allegro and most likely compiled with version a=
cl62w. He would have run the program from within the Allegro integrated env=
ironment as he rarely made executable versions. The executable versions wer=
e typically only made for exhibitions and unfortunately we do not have a kn=
own executable ones from this time period. Because we do not have any known=
 executables we can't say how big the program was. However, I did look at o=
ne of the aaron6 versions. It consisted of 1.1MB of typed code in 79 source=
 code files. Unfortunately, Harold rarely used comments so this 1.1MB is al=
most all hand typed Lisp source code. Because we no longer have the compute=
r that he used to created the works shown at the show, we can't say for sur=
e how long it took AARON to generated a particular image but it is believed=
 to have been 1 to 7 minutes or so depending on complexity.=20

As for notebooks, Harold seemed to have stopped using paper notebooks on a =
regular basis sometime in the 1990s which is prior to these works. However,=
 Harold did continue to write for publications. I don't see any written in =
2003 but the following two were written in 2002.
Leonardo: Journal of the International
Society for the Arts,Sciences and
Technology (Volume 35, No. 1, 2002)
Here is a link to another 2002 publication which links to our website. Alth=
ough it is written in 2002, starting on page 29 he does dive into some deta=
ils that maybe be of interest
https://aaronshome.com/aaron/publications/changingworld.doc
On Monday, I will look to see if we have any additional computer note files=
 from 2003 in our archives.=20

 Hi both,=C2=A0
Hope all is well!=C2=A0Paul, looking forward to our catch up Monday but in =
the meantime wanted to touch base to let you know that the exhibition is up=
 and open and getting a lot of interest.=C2=A0
2 works have now been sold with another 3 being considered. Once the physic=

There was an enquiry from one of the top NFT collectors re the actual progr=
am producing these (some technical questions). Is there anything we can sha=
