Hi Christiane,
I hope your year is off to a good start and that you are involved with exci=
ting enjoyable efforts. Hard to believe a year has past already since we we=
re there with you at your incredible Whitney evident for Harold and his AAR=
ON.=C2=A0
I am currently working on identifying AARON works executed during the Harol=
d=E2=80=99s transition period away from the painting machine toward his use=
 of wide-format commercial printers (1998-2002). At the moment, I am focusi=
ng on Harolds year 2000 efforts =E2=80=94 just prior to KCAT=E2=80=99s rele=
ase. There is this one digital image that seems like an outlier. Based on t=
he imagery it seems to belong to June of 2000 except for one stylistic feat=
ure =E2=80=94 the nose. =C2=A0
I know that after the initial KCAT release, Harold began an effort to remov=
e all the black lines. The earliest dated evidence I have seen of the lines=
 being removed is May 2001. This artwork has no people though. The earliest=
 dated evidence we have of people without the line drawing is Oct of 2001. =
After Oct 2001, the lines are completely gone until 2012.=C2=A0
I recall Harold commenting in particular about the line used to make the no=
se and how to handle its removal. From that view point it might be possible=
 that the work in question was a kind of transitional/experiment work of hi=
s. A transitional work that would be post KCAT and pre-line removal. And if=
 so, maybe he used an earlier 2000 AARON version to do an experiment. This =
is just a guess. Ideally, I find other examples of this nose prior to May 2=
001.=C2=A0
When I look through our people with faces works (1990=E2=80=99s to 2001), I=
 have yet to find a nose like this one. AARON did have the capacity to gene=
rate a wide range of variety and I haven=E2=80=99t necessarily seen the ext=
ent of its variety. Your Whitney show did produce a large number of works. =
In fact we have many of them here in the studio. I believe looking through =
this collection will help me resolve this issue and possibly others to come=
.=C2=A0
We do plan on photographing the works you sent to us sometime in the future=
, I am wondering if there is a way to look through the Whitney KCAT collect=
ion without having to do so physically and prior to photographing them.
I would appreciate any thoughts you have on this matter.
Sincerely,Tom Machnik
