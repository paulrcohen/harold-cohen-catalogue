 Dear Brett Stalbaum,
Thank-you for your interest in Harold Cohen=E2=80=99s work and for your int=
roduction. I recall working with Sheldon Brown on the 2017 UCSD show "Creat=
ing Computational Creativity.=E2=80=9D I was also worked on Harold=E2=80=99=
s 2011 show "Collaborations with my other self.=E2=80=9D =C2=A0And it was d=
uring the prep for the show I met Sheldon for the first time.
It seems you have already done some planning. I have a couple initial quest=
ions. Do you have a time frame for the show? With respect to creating a spe=
cial exhibition while getting some art history grads involved, has there be=
en any discussion on how that would shape the exhibition content? In other =
words, are you considering a historical dive?
I am currently working on resolving multiple Harold Cohen mysteries. One of=
 these mysteries has to do with his 1976 mural titled =E2=80=9CDrawing for =
Machine and Four Hands=E2=80=9D executed at UCSD =E2=80=94 a very early AAR=
ON work in a public space. Unfortunately, I unable to find any photos in ou=
r archive of the completed work =E2=80=94 only a few cropped segments. Does=
 this work still exist on campus? Who would I contact at UCSD regarding any=
 possible historical photos of this work?=C2=A0
Also in our archives are mentions of Faculty shows but very little info on =
the works shown. There was a mention of a 1968 Fall show for example. This =
would have been just weeks after arriving to the campus. What was shown at =
that time? There are many other UCSD shows he participated in as well. Also=
 in our archives is a mention of a 1995 Machine Painting being on loan to t=
he UCSD Chancellor=E2=80=99s office (TCM#38). Is that still there?=C2=A0
I mention these because I am wondering if the direction you are pursuing is=
 to highlight Harold=E2=80=99s direct contributions to UCSD. Harold built m=
ultiple drawing machines and painting machines and the turtle with much gro=
w and development happened on the campus over time. And while AARON may hav=
e come to life at Stanford, it seems our oldest screen captures of AARON wo=
rks are when Harold was here in San Diego and connecting to the Stanford co=
mputer via telephone line thereby running AARON remotely. This was 1975. An=
d of course there are multiple high end computers he used on campus and hel=
ped acquire. That is another mystery... what happened to the various comput=
er equipment. We have photos and video of these older systems using open re=
el tapes and removable hard drives. What happened to media? Do they still e=
xist somewhere and if so, is there any code on any of the media or in print=
ed form? Speaking of video and photos what additional media does UCSD have?=
 Are you thinking in this direction? Or something else especially with resp=
ect to involving the art history grad.

Regarding a potential zoom meeting, can you provide some potential times, d=
ates and expected length of time. If we were to pull the Director of The Ha=
rold Cohen Trust =E2=80=94 Paul Cohen =E2=80=94 we need to keep in mind he =
is on the east coast.=C2=A0
Looking forward to hearing more. And hope at some point some of my question=
s can be answered.
Sincerely,Thomas Machnik =E2=80=94 Art Studio Manager =E2=80=94 The Harold =
Cohen Trust

 Thank you all! Yes I would like to loop a colleague in if we could zoom or=
 something? I teach Harold's work in a large introductory course, and the M=
AG (Mandeville Art Gallery on which I serve as advisory board member) very =
much wants to make something special happen for our colleague! I did not kn=
ow Harold, as he (essentially, hiring is more complex than this) had brough=
t on Sheldon Brown who later brought me on, but just personally I feel the =
history every day. I have had Harold centered in our large survey of comput=
ing in the arts course and lectures on AI since arriving. I trust with your=
 help we can strengthen this pedagogy, get some art history grads involved =
and create a special exhibition, discussion panels, etc. In fact, much of t=
his had been in the planning phases when COVID hit, waylaying many things, =
and we really want to get back to it!

Hi Tom,A while back I sent an email, which I have copied below regarding a =
show at UCSD. I'm circling back to see if you saw it, if you thought about =
it, or contacted Paul. If its a no, I will understand and move on. I just t=
hink UCSD is a fitting place to have Harold's work shown either at the gall=
ery or even CRCA.Thanks=C2=A0Nina

Tom,Yesterday I was speaking to Brett Stalbaum. He is a professor at UC tha=
t Harold helped to get in (I think). He had mentioned that the faculty want=
ed to have a showing of Harold's work at the UC gallery, but couldn't affor=
d it. I said I would ask you if it was possible to have a show with a lesse=
r cost, not through the museum.If this is a question for Paul, please give =
me his email or phone contact.
Thanks and I missed seeing you guys yesterday at Trail Fest, and I totally =
understand the long drive aspect. The weather was on our side with billowy =
clouds and sun. There were many exhausted=C2=A0and hungry hikers. Sheriffs =
on horses. The Native American singers arrived 2 hours late and did a great=
 job.I'll keep you on my list to notify you in the future. If you want to c=
ome out for a hike just with Ralf and I, that would be welcomed too.Nina

computers he used on campus and helped acquire. That is another mystery... =
what happened to the various computer equipment. We have photos and video o=
f these older systems using open reel tapes and removable hard drives. What=
 happened to media? Do they still exist somewhere and if so, is there any c=
ode on any of the media or in printed form? Speaking of video and photos wh=
at additional media does UCSD have? Are you thinking in this direction? Or =
something else especially with respect to involving the art history grad.<b=

<div>Thank you all! Yes I would like to loop a colleague in if we could zoo=
m or something? I teach Harold's work in a large introductory course, and t=
he MAG (Mandeville Art Gallery on which I serve as advisory board member) v=
ery much wants to make
 something special happen for our colleague! I did not know Harold, as he (=
essentially, hiring is more complex than this) had brought on Sheldon Brown=
 who later brought me on, but just personally I feel the history every day.=
 I have had Harold centered in our
 large survey of computing in the arts course and lectures on AI since arri=
ving. I trust with your help we can strengthen this pedagogy, get some art =
history grads involved and create a special exhibition, discussion panels, =
etc. In fact, much of this had been
 in the planning phases when COVID hit, waylaying many things, and we reall=
y want to get back to it!</div>

<div>Hi Tom,</div>
<div>A while back I sent an email, which I have copied below regarding a sh=
ow at UCSD. I'm circling back to see if you saw it, if you thought about it=
, or contacted Paul. If its a no, I will understand and move on. I just thi=
nk UCSD is a fitting place to have
 Harold's work shown either at the gallery or even CRCA.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<div>Tom,</div>
<div>Yesterday I was speaking to Brett Stalbaum. He is a professor at UC th=
at Harold helped to get in (I think). He had mentioned that the faculty wan=
ted to have a showing of Harold's work at the UC gallery, but couldn't affo=
rd it. I said I would ask you if
 it was possible to have a show with a lesser cost, not through the museum.=
</div>
<div>If this is a question for Paul, please give me his email or phone cont=
act.</div>
<div><br clear=3D"none">
</div>
<div>Thanks and I missed seeing you guys yesterday at Trail Fest, and I tot=
ally understand the long drive aspect. The weather was on our side with bil=
lowy clouds and sun. There were many exhausted&nbsp;and hungry hikers. Sher=
iffs on horses. The Native American singers
 arrived 2 hours late and did a great job.</div>
<div>I'll keep you on my list to notify you in the future. If you want to c=
ome out for a hike just with Ralf and I, that would be welcomed too.</div>
