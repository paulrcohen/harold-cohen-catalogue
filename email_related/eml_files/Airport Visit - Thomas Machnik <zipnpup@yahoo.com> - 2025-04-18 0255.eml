Hi Paul,I was able to meet with Daniel at the San Diego Airport today and h=
e took me on a tour showing me the spaces. I took some photos which I will =
upload tomorrow. In general there are two different kind of spaces. One bei=
ng flat walls =E2=80=94 or nearly flat =E2=80=94 and the other being big gl=
ass cases set into the wall space. The flat spaces could possibly accommoda=
te projection but I am not quite sure because people would be walking by. D=
aniel seems to think it would be doable so maybe it is. The glass cases are=
 approximately 8 ft high although one might be a bit shorter. The width var=
ies with the biggest around 16 ft. There is one space that people would see=
 as there are going through the TSA queue. This is one of the glass spaces.=
 The remaining spaces are all on the other side after going through TSA. On=
 the way toward the international terminal area is one of the flat wall spa=
ces. Daniel was concerned about using this as a projection space because th=
ere tend to be ambient light and shadows on the space. It is quite a good s=
ize space though. We don=E2=80=99t have measurement but I suspect it is 20 =
ft long and the height 6-8ft. Continuing down the hallway into the terminal=
 area there is a seating area with 3 walls surrounding the space. Each wall=
 has glass cases. Electricity is available in each of the cases if necessar=
y. Then down on the opposite side of the terminal there is another flat spa=
ce and for the current show they had multiple canvas pieces. This space has=
 a low ceiling compared to the others spaces.=C2=A0
In additional to showing the spaces, Daniel talked about the stipend and be=
cause it is quite low he prepared me in advance. He said the stipend would =
$1,500. However, he said that they would handle all the shipping, handling =
logistics and insurance. He also said that normally there is a proposal sub=
mission process but that he would talk legal to try to get that waved.=C2=
=A0
I also asked about timelines and basically whatever would be shown would be=
 picked up sometime in December. And the decision on what would be shown ha=
s to be decided by August.=C2=A0
We did talk about an active plotter. Based on what I saw, any plotter would=
 have to be vertical. And with respect loading paper a roll or some other m=
ethod would need to be implemented to minimize having to have a person inte=
ract with the plotter. I ask Daniel what he thought the maximum interaction=
 with plotter would be. He thought that a maximum of once every two weeks. =
Although, if the staff at the airport were not involved, he seemed to think=
 it could be more often.=C2=A0
So that is kind of the summary.=C2=A0
I am =C2=A0putting on my thinking cap. At this time, I would prefer the gla=
ss cases. Unfortunately having a traditional projection in the cases would =
not be practical. However, I do see Samsung has interesting solution whereb=
y the image is projected from the floor onto a rolled screen (see link belo=
w). Nice idea, but I rather think a more narrow system would be required fo=
r the airport cases. If we want to go that route of we=E2=80=99d need a sol=
ution that fits inside the case. I do think a mechanical machine would be m=
ore engaging. The projections are nice but with the nature of the world tod=
ay with screens everywhere I wonder if another screen would just be another=
 screen and would get lost. I know we don=E2=80=99t have much time, but I=
=E2=80=99m wondering if an unconventional solution can be found. A plotter =
that is more like a etch-a-sketch that doesn=E2=80=99t require paper. =C2=
=A0Or one that plots on a white board that can then be erased or something =
similar. I=E2=80=99m also wondering how we might implement a way for people=
 to have an image as a take-away. I know we don=E2=80=99t have much time, b=
ut what if we had an app that worked only in proximity of the display. And =
if they like the image being generated they could capture it on with the ap=
p in some way maybe. Thereby having their own NFT of sorts. An NFT that we =
would still have control over.=C2=A0
We could just go with static pieces too.=C2=A0
=C2=A0If you want to talk more about it we can.=C2=A0
