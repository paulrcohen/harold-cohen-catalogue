 Hi Kanoko,Thanks so much! I haven't listened to the whole lecture yet eith=
er but there are certainly some important points. FUN did a good job with f=
ilming HC's slides. Other lectures we have tend to have very poor quality c=
aptures of the slides or no slides at all. Also important was that HC showe=
d AARON running at that time. It looks similar to KCAT but I have to study =
it more. I may be more like an post KCAT version.=20

Hi KanokoIf you a have a free moment can you look at the email below and go=

I am working with Yoshiaki Mima regarding a lecture HC gave at Future Unive=
rsity in Japan (FUN). It took a while but he graciously made the effort to =
convert it from tape and share the link but we have access now. The lecture=
 is in English and sounds like it is being translated as he goes through th=
e lecture. If you have some time can you listen at least to the beginning w=
here they are speaking Japanese and where I assume they are introducing HC.=
 And can you give me any important details like where they are. Who invited=
 him. Why they are there etc. Or any other info you may think is pertinent.

Dear Tom,

I am sorry for the delay of this answer.
I had to spend more time to convert movie file than I expected.
Anyway, I uploaded two mpeg4 files at the following URL.
