 Dear Brett,
The studio is in Encinitas. We might be able to meet at the studio at some =
point depending on the timing. I am in the middle of something in the studi=
o that should not be disturbed. I=E2=80=99m wondering if maybe an initial z=
oom call would be preferred. This way we get an overview and recap of where=
 Ceci Moss is at and potentially ascertain what resources from the Trust UC=
SD would be seeking. Then based on that, I believe a studio visit would be =
more productive.=C2=A0
These are my thoughts,
SincererlyThomas Machnik =E2=80=94 Art Studio Manager =E2=80=94 The Harold =
Cohen Trust

Thank Thomas. To answer your questions, this is why I would like to bring C=
eci Moss into the conversation. They were working on something up through l=
ast year that I don't fully understand as I only joined the advisory commit=
tee this year. I just know we had to withdraw for some reason.
=20
We do have some deep archive divers around here and some fantastic things h=
ave been dredged up, but that has not included my involvement. But I can ce=
rtainly imagine an initiative related to an exhibition! I will help in my c=
apacity in every way I can.
=20
 I am also keen to be involved and to get my ICAM students involved, in fac=
t I was added to the advisory committee specifically because I have an ongo=
ing agenda to get undergrads involved in such things. Btw, I am Teaching Pr=
ofessor, a position with particular focus on undergraduate education, and I=
 have organized special studies classes in the past to specifically perform=
 new media archeology. That is a way I can contribute, possibly.
=20
=20
I really think us being in conversation including the MAG director who was =
involved in the abandoned effort, getting her into this loop would be great=
. Can we invite you both to campus, or possibly come to where you are? (Nin=
a and I are both backcountry SD people, as it turns out. This was a serendi=
pitous connection indeed!)

  Dear Brett Stalbaum,=20
  Thank-you for your interest in Harold Cohen=E2=80=99s work and for your i=
ntroduction. I recall working with Sheldon Brown on the 2017 UCSD show "Cre=
ating Computational Creativity.=E2=80=9D I was also worked on Harold=E2=80=
=99s 2011 show "Collaborations with my other self.=E2=80=9D =C2=A0And it wa=
s during the prep for the show I met Sheldon for the first time.=20
  It seems you have already done some planning. I have a couple initial que=
stions. Do you have a time frame for the show? With respect to creating a s=
pecial exhibition while getting some art history grads involved, has there =
been any discussion on how that would shape the exhibition content? In othe=
r words, are you considering a historical dive?=20
  I am currently working on resolving multiple Harold Cohen mysteries. One =
of these mysteries has to do with his 1976 mural titled =E2=80=9CDrawing fo=
r Machine and Four Hands=E2=80=9D executed at UCSD =E2=80=94 a very early A=
ARON work in a public space. Unfortunately, I unable to find any photos in =
our archive of the completed work =E2=80=94 only a few cropped segments. Do=
es this work still exist on campus? Who would I contact at UCSD regarding a=
ny possible historical photos of this work?=C2=A0=20
  Also in our archives are mentions of Faculty shows but very little info o=
n the works shown. There was a mention of a 1968 Fall show for example. Thi=
s would have been just weeks after arriving to the campus. What was shown a=
t that time? There are many other UCSD shows he participated in as well. Al=
so in our archives is a mention of a 1995 Machine Painting being on loan to=
 the UCSD Chancellor=E2=80=99s office (TCM#38). Is that still there?=C2=A0=
=20
  I mention these because I am wondering if the direction you are pursuing =
is to highlight Harold=E2=80=99s direct contributions to UCSD. Harold built=
 multiple drawing machines and painting machines and the turtle with much g=
row and development happened on the campus over time. And while AARON may h=
ave come to life at Stanford, it seems our oldest screen captures of AARON =
works are when Harold was here in San Diego and connecting to the Stanford =
computer via telephone line thereby running AARON remotely. This was 1975. =
And of course there are multiple high end computers he used on campus and h=
elped acquire. That is another mystery... what happened to the various comp=
uter equipment. We have photos and video of these older systems using open =
reel tapes and removable hard drives. What happened to media? Do they still=
 exist somewhere and if so, is there any code on any of the media or in pri=
nted form? Speaking of video and photos what additional media does UCSD hav=
e? Are you thinking in this direction? Or something else especially with re=
spect to involving the art history grad.
 =20
  Regarding a potential zoom meeting, can you provide some potential times,=
 dates and expected length of time. If we were to pull the Director of The =
Harold Cohen Trust =E2=80=94 Paul Cohen =E2=80=94 we need to keep in mind h=

    Hi Tom, A while back I sent an email, which I have copied below regardi=
ng a show at UCSD. I'm circling back to see if you saw it, if you thought a=
bout it, or contacted Paul. If its a no, I will understand and move on. I j=

 gallery or even CRCA. Thanks =C2=A0Nina=20
 =20
   Tom, Yesterday I was speaking to Brett Stalbaum. He is a professor at UC=
 that Harold helped to get in (I think). He had mentioned that the faculty =
wanted to have a showing of Harold's work at the UC gallery, but couldn't a=
fford it. I said I would ask you if it was possible to have a show with a l=
esser cost, not through the museum. If this is a question for Paul, please =
give me his email or phone contact.=20
  Thanks and I missed seeing you guys yesterday at Trail Fest, and I totall=
y understand the long drive aspect. The weather was on our side with billow=
y clouds and sun. There were many exhausted=C2=A0and hungry hikers. Sheriff=
s on horses. The Native American singers arrived 2 hours late and did a gre=

    <p>Thank Thomas. To answer your questions, this is why I would like
      to bring Ceci Moss into the conversation. They were working on
      something up through last year that I don't fully understand as I
      only joined the advisory committee this year. I just know we had
      to withdraw for some reason.</p>
    <p>We do have some deep archive divers around here and some
      fantastic things have been dredged up, but that has not included
      my involvement. But I can certainly imagine an initiative related
      to an exhibition! I will help in my capacity in every way I can.<br c=

      <br clear=3D"none">
      I am also keen to be involved and to get my ICAM students
      involved, in fact I was added to the advisory committee
      specifically because I have an ongoing agenda to get undergrads
      involved in such things. Btw, I am Teaching Professor, a position
      with particular focus on undergraduate education, and I have
      organized special studies classes in the past to specifically
      perform new media archeology. That is a way I can contribute,
      possibly.<br clear=3D"none">
    </p>
    <p>I really think us being in conversation including the MAG
      director who was involved in the abandoned effort, getting her
      into this loop would be great. Can we invite you both to campus,
      or possibly come to where you are? (Nina and I are both
      backcountry SD people, as it turns out. This was a serendipitous
      connection indeed!)</p>

          What was shown at that time? There are many other UCSD shows
          he participated in as well. Also in our archives is a mention
          of a 1995 Machine Painting being on loan to the UCSD

          Harold=E2=80=99s direct contributions to UCSD. Harold built multi=

          drawing machines and painting machines and the turtle with
          much grow and development happened on the campus over time.
          And while AARON may have come to life at Stanford, it seems
          our oldest screen captures of AARON works are when Harold was
          here in San Diego and connecting to the Stanford computer via
          telephone line thereby running AARON remotely. This was 1975.
          And of course there are multiple high end computers he used on
          campus and helped acquire. That is another mystery... what
          happened to the various computer equipment. We have photos and
          video of these older systems using open reel tapes and
          removable hard drives. What happened to media? Do they still
          exist somewhere and if so, is there any code on any of the
          media or in printed form? Speaking of video and photos what
          additional media does UCSD have? Are you thinking in this

                  <div>Thank you all! Yes I would like to loop a
                    colleague in if we could zoom or something? I teach
                    Harold's work in a large introductory course, and
                    the MAG (Mandeville Art Gallery on which I serve as
                    advisory board member) very much wants to make
                    something special happen for our colleague! I did
                    not know Harold, as he (essentially, hiring is more
                    complex than this) had brought on Sheldon Brown who
                    later brought me on, but just personally I feel the
                    history every day. I have had Harold centered in our
                    large survey of computing in the arts course and
                    lectures on AI since arriving. I trust with your
                    help we can strengthen this pedagogy, get some art
                    history grads involved and create a special
                    exhibition, discussion panels, etc. In fact, much of
                    this had been in the planning phases when COVID hit,
                    waylaying many things, and we really want to get
                    back to it!</div>

                              <div>Hi Tom,</div>
                              <div>A while back I sent an email, which I
                                have copied below regarding a show at
                                UCSD. I'm circling back to see if you
                                saw it, if you thought about it, or
                                contacted Paul. If its a no, I will
                                understand and move on. I just think
                                UCSD is a fitting place to have Harold's
                                work shown either at the gallery or even
                                CRCA.</div>
                              <div>Thanks</div>

                                <div>Yesterday I was speaking to Brett
                                  Stalbaum. He is a professor at UC that
                                  Harold helped to get in (I think). He
                                  had mentioned that the faculty wanted
                                  to have a showing of Harold's work at
                                  the UC gallery, but couldn't afford
                                  it. I said I would ask you if it was
                                  possible to have a show with a lesser
                                  cost, not through the museum.</div>
                                <div>If this is a question for Paul,
                                  please give me his email or phone
                                  contact.</div>

                                <div>Thanks and I missed seeing you guys
                                  yesterday at Trail Fest, and I totally
                                  understand the long drive aspect. The
                                  weather was on our side with billowy
                                  clouds and sun. There were many
                                  exhausted&nbsp;and hungry hikers. Sheriff=

                                  on horses. The Native American singers
                                  arrived 2 hours late and did a great
                                  job.</div>
                                <div>I'll keep you on my list to notify
                                  you in the future. If you want to come
                                  out for a hike just with Ralf and I,
                                  that would be welcomed too.</div>
