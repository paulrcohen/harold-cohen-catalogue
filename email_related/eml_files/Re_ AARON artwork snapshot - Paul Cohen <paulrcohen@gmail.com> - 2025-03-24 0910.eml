Hi Tom, I=E2=80=99m not familiar with the picture but there were a lot =
of them and I might have seen it but forgotten it.  The resolution is =
low so I can=E2=80=99t make out the weaving together of color groups, =
though I can see that it=E2=80=99s happening, which make me think it is =
probably authentic.  I=E2=80=99m a bit surprised at the bright rim of =
the pot; I don=E2=80=99t recall Harold doing that.  Who is the email =
from?  =E2=80=94P
