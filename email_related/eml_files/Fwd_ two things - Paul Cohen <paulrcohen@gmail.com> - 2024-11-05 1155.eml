Hi Paul
There maybe some surprises once we actually go through it all but basically
we have 1/2 of Kanoko's room done this year (1/2 based on space not qty)
The finished 1/2 consists of primarily unsigned 2000s work small framed
works, large unframed and unsigned panel works.

Works get to be accounted for

Kanoko's room.
Large cloth mural panels 1980s qty +/-6
Large panels +/- '05-'09 qty +/-12
Whitney Plots 2024 qty ? +/-1000?
Test prints canvas&paper 2000's qty dozens
Large test prints 2000 qty ?? 1 Dozen?


Studio
Sculptures 1980s qty +/- 1/2 dozen
Most of these are black&white and unfinished


Rolled work in studio
Large rolled canvases 60sto80s +/-2dozen
Rolled canvases 2000s +/- half dozen
Rolled Early Calcomp plots +/-1970 +/-50

Flat unsigned work in studio
Test prints 2000s qty multiple hundreds
1980s plotted work +/-100
Earliest full color prints +/-2001 +/-dozen
Small early color prints '02-'06 +/-2dozen
Brush machine works +/-1989 +/- 1/2dozen

Some signed work which were previously inventoried in 2016 are located both
flat in drawers and in one vertical storage bay.  Some framed prints and
framed panels other stretched canvases. Mix of hand painted and untouched
works. Again these were all previously inventoried in 2016 and are signed.

Flat in drawers various dates +/- couple dozen
Not in drawers framed or stretched mostly 2000s +/-couple dozen


Regarding relocating work

I mentioned the relocating of work to Mila and Robert when they were here.
Throwing out the idea that as part of the next show shipment to Gazelli, we
should also include works we are considered about preserving. To me I am
not sure it makes a difference where they are located either locally,
London or else where. I rather think that the location depends on the
intended target. If we see a particular group belonging to the the Tate,
V&A and the like, then it would make sense to have it there more locally to
the intended targets. If there are more North American opportunities or
even Asian, it may make more sense to have it here more local.

Hi Tom, just a couple of followup things from my meeting with Mila this
morning.

I understand that you inventoried roughly 4000 works and there are still
some to be done.  Knowing that it'll take a while to do the remaining
inventory, what do you think of the following idea:  Could you make a rough
classification of what remains to be inventoried?  Here's my thinking:  We
need a five-year plan for raising prices, so we need to know the whole
inventory, but we're most concerned about high-valued works, and
particularly how many we have (i.e., rarity).  If you knew, for example,
that we have 20 paintings in a particular category, then for the purpose of
strategic planning we wouldn't need to inventory them immediately, because
just knowing that there are 20 would be hugely helpful.  What do you think?

The other topic is storage.  We're both concerned about storing work in the
house simply because the house is old and not very secure. Again wrt
high-value work we could ship more of it to London (or New York if Mila
does in fact open a gallery there) or to local safe storage in San Diego.
What do you think?

Thanks! --P
