Tom, I had a long-delayed chat with Mila today.  Just to let you know that
George handed in his notice.  One reason seems to be that the art market is
very dead right now.  Apparently nothing sold at the Gazelli booth at
Dallas, despite them showing a glorious selection of $3M worth of Cohen,
Boshier, and Boty. The upshot is that this is a good time for all the
back-burner projects.  --P
