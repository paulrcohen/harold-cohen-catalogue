Hi Tom, thanks for the invoice, which I just paid.  I saw the email thread
about an exhibition to honor Harold and I agree with your reply, which if I
remember was "Ok, when and where and how shall we start planning?"

I'm packing to move to Boston (the truck arrives on Tuesday) so it'll be a
bit hectic for a few days.  I don't know that it makes sense to fly to CA
for a meeting as suggested by Nina, but I could certainly participate by
zoom, and also I might have to come to CA for Trust legal stuff -- that's
less clear.

I'll write to Nina et al now.

-P
