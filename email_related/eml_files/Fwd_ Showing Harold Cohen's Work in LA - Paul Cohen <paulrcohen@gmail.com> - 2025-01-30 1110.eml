Hi Paul,

My name is Neil Mendoza, I'm an artist working with technology. I saw you
teach at Pitt. Coincidentally, I actually have a few pieces installed at
the Children's Museum there including a drawing machine.

I'm helping a friend curate a show for Ctrl Gallery, a new pop up in LA.
The show will open on February 15th for three weeks so it will be open
during Frieze week when a lot of the art world is in town. The show is
based around machine imagination and I think your father's work would be a
perfect fit if there is anything available. I was just in London and really
enjoyed seeing his work at Electric Dreams at the Tate modern!

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!

Neil
