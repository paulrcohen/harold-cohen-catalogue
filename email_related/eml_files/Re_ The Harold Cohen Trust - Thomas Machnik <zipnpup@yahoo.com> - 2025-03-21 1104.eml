Dear Mima,

Thanks you so much! I downloaded the videos of Harold=E2=80=99s talk and th=
ey play fine. I will be reviewing the whole video soon. It is okay if you c=
annot access your old emails. But if you still have the interview between y=
ou and Harold from the year 2000, and it is not too much trouble, I would a=
ppreciate being able to listen to it.


Sincerely,
Tom

 About Harold's Talk movie, https://thinking-sketch.sakura.ne.jp/cohen/
 please try to access them by (id,pw)=3D(harold,cohen).
 Those two MP4 files (339.4MB and 423.1MB) might be too big,=20
 but I will recommend you to DL and keep them in your trust.
 (Please let me know if you have download them successfully.)

 As for the mail about my question to Harold, I am not sure what it was.
 My old email data do not have easy way to read,=20
 and I am not sure where the data is kept or not.
 So, unfortunately, it will take long time to find it.

 My first visit to Harold was in Nov 2000 and I talked with him about AARON=
.
 The date was very closed to the presidential election in Nov 2000.
=20
 At that time, my colleague recorded the conversation between Harold and me=
.
 You might be interested in it. I will try to find it.
