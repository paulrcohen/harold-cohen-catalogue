 Dear Andrew,Thank you for the list. I know it is not much but every little=
 be helps. I am familiar with "It'll Never Work" as we have this programme =
on VHS tape. We also have a VHS tape of "Knowledge Talks: The Turing Test" =
but I did not have the date of the work so the date was very helpful. In re=
gards to "Open University: Artware..." We have a tape with a printed label.=
 Some of the text is difficult to read but it might read as:
A.LAW BBC OPEN UNIVERSITY ?OUM535A M206/TV10This is a PAL format VHS and si=
nce we only have NTSC equipment I have yet to view it. There is a date of o=
n the tape being 17/1/97. Based on this limited information, can you tell i=
f this is the same programme as the Open University 24/04/97? If not, might=
 you be able tell me what this programme is about?=20

In regards to the Newsnight 07/06/83 programme. This the first time to lear=
n of this one. Cohen was in London around that time for a show at the Tate.=
 Can you tell if the "Item on Computer Art" was filmed at the Tate Museum o=
n our about the date of airing? In other words, is there a way to know wher=
e & when the filming took place?=20

Sincerely, Thomas

Dear Andrew,
=20
Much thanks for looking into our requests and for the quick response. Sorry=
 for my delayed response as I was following up on another lead regarding th=
e Director of Sunday Night: Five for Venice.=20
=20
 =C2=A0
=20
I understand the "Sunday Night: Five for Venice" is no longer extant in you=
r archives. I have since found some additional information which confirms w=
hat you wrote but also hope that maybe a copy still is extant. I understand=
 the late Ann Turner (1927-2018) was the film director of the programme. In=
 a voice recorded interviewed by Alan Lawson in 1995 she provides the detai=
ls on the films demise where she says*(see note below), "BBC One, I had a f=
ive for Venice on the 25th of October in 1966. I'd spent a year following a=
round the British Council something we could never do these days. Actually,=
 with the five artists concern, which are known as Tony Cairo, Danny Cairo,=
 Robin Denny now CBE, the two Cohen's Harold and Bernard and Dick Smith and=
 Lillian Somerville, Sir Herbert Read. David Thompson was involved as the c=
atalogue was his. And I think it's a very interesting film. And I would ver=
y much like to see it except BBC lent it to Nancy for ?OU? thing. Humphrey =
had not signed the retention order. And the thing was junked with its negat=
ive when it came back to film library, Alan Hanson nearly went through the =
roof, because you know all those artists are important. And they were all i=
n their studios talking about their work."
=20
 =C2=A0
=20
That is a pity. But Ann Turner goes on to say later in the interview,"One o=
f the things I have not followed up is if whether the British Council, I ma=
y simply have given them a copy with luck, they might have kept it you know=
."=C2=A0 Do you have any thoughts on how I would approach the British Counc=
il to ask if they have a copy?
=20
 =C2=A0

Also regarding the other finds. This is wonderful news. What do we need to =
do to get a listing of sorts from you?

Dear Thomas

Thank you for contacting the BBC Archives.
=20
=C2=A0
=20
I can tell you that the material described in your documents relates to two=
 different programmes, one TV and one radio.
=20
=C2=A0
=20
The TV programme was called =E2=80=9CSunday Night: Five for Venice=E2=80=9D=
, this was shown on BBC1 on 25 September 1966. Unfortunately this programme=
 no longer exists in the BBC Archives.
=20
=C2=A0
=20
The other programme was broadcast in a series called =E2=80=9CSome American=
 Artists=E2=80=9D on 20 March 1967 on BBC radio (Network Three, one of the =
forerunners of Radio 3), although it looks like it was probably recorded tw=
o years earlier as per your information. This programme does exist in the B=
BC Archives.
=20
=C2=A0

Apart from this item, we also have some later programmes which feature Haro=
ld Cohen, which we can give you details of if required.
=20
=C2=A0
=20
We may be able to give you access to these existing programmes to view or l=
isten to for research purposes, if you are looking to use them beyond that =
we would need details of what use you proposed to make of them, and we can =
advise what may be possible based on that.

Dear BBC Archivist,
=20
My name is Thomas Machnik and I am the Art Studio Manager for the Harold Co=
hen Trust. Harold Cohen (1928-2016) was a prominent British artist both as =
a painter and then later developed AARON -- AI computer based art. I am cur=
rently doing research for the Trust. Based on the Trust archives, we know C=
ohen appeared on BBC TV and radio. We are trying to determine if these appe=
arances are still extant. What type of information would you need in order =
to determine if you have any film or audio? In some cases we only have a re=
ference alluding to an interview. But we do have a couple typed up document=
s that looks like TV transcripts. One of the transcripts has the following =
details:
=20
BARNET NEWMAN talking to David Sylvester
=20
Producer: Leonie Cohn

Transmission: Wednesday 17th November 1965: 2140-2215

Tape No: CTAM 42905

=C2=A0

This transcript is 13 pages and it has a second transcript titled, "INTRODU=
CTION TO BARNETT NEWMAN INTERVIEW WITH DAVID SYLVESTER by John Richardson" =
and says the length is 7'10"

Based on reading the transcripts the show is primarily about Newman. But on=
 page 4 of the second transcript=C2=A0 it reads, "As Harold Cohen is going =
to discuss the nature of Newman's impact on himself and others later in the=
 programme, I will say no more than that."

=C2=A0

These two transcripts are the same folder so we assume they go together eve=
n though the John Richardson transcript portion does not have any of the de=
tails like time date or tape number. In this same folder we do not have any=
 transcript of Harold Cohen speaking. But we do have a separate folder with=
 a TV transcript and wonder if this TV transcript belongs with the above or=
 with a separate transmission. The Harold Cohen transcript has a column tha=
t includes camera directions. For example it starts off like this:
=20
=C2=A0

130/2 Top shot
=20
from ladder

---------------

H.C. unrolls canvas
=20
=C2=A0

Then on the 4 page it has a header that reads:
=20
ROLL ONE: SUNDAY NIGHT: PROJECT NO. 5616/0109
=20
LOCATION - N.LONDON
=20
------------------------------------------------------------------
=20
The people talking are only referred to by initials. The intiials are prima=
rily HC, DT. But on ROLL TWO we see A.T. Question and HC, then on ROLL SIX =
(we don't have ROLLS 3-5) we see LS, HC, HR, AG.
=20
=C2=A0
=20
If the Tape NO CTAM 42905 really was transmitted Nov 17, 1965, I rather thi=
nk this PROJECT NO 5616/0109 might be bit later as there is much discussion=
 about the British Pavillion at the Venice Bienalle XXIII 1966. Much of the=
 transcript refers to artwork that will be rolled up and sent to the Bienal=
le. I believe the show opened June 1966. So this interview would be sometim=
e in Spring 1966 I image.
=20
=C2=A0
=20
We do have a typed document in a separate folder with a document inside tit=
led "BARNETT NEWMAN by Harold Cohen". It does not have the same look as a T=
V transcript but maybe a draft for the 1965 TV show. This work is not dated=
 but it begins like this, "In his interview with David Sylvester, Newman gi=
ves a very full and really very technical account of the way his painting d=
eveloped...." Though it is not dated we suspect it belongs to CTAM 42905 ta=
pe. And that PROJECT NO 5616/0109 is separate TV transmission. In any case,=
 we are hoping to resolve these unknowns with your help.
=20
=C2=A0

Ultimately, we would like to view any video the BBC may have of Cohen or at=
 a minimum determine what is still extant. I provided the above as it is th=
e most detail we have pointing to a specific recording. We are quite sure s=
ome of his other events were also filmed by the BBC. What type of informati=
on would you need to help us determine what is still extant? If you could a=
dvise me further on how to proceed, that would be most appreciated.

e" is no longer extant in your archives. I have since found some additional=
 information which confirms what you wrote but also
 hope that maybe a copy still is extant. I understand the late Ann Turner (=
1927-2018) was the film director of the programme. In a voice recorded inte=
rviewed by Alan Lawson in 1995 she provides the details on the films demise=
 where she says*(see note below),
 "BBC One, I had a five for Venice on the 25th of October in 1966. I'd spen=
t a year following around the British Council something we could never do t=
hese days. Actually, with the five artists concern, which are known as Tony=
 Cairo, Danny Cairo, Robin Denny
 now CBE, the two Cohen's Harold and Bernard and Dick Smith and Lillian Som=
erville, Sir Herbert Read. David Thompson was involved as the catalogue was=
 his. And I think it's a very interesting film. And I would very much like =
to see it except BBC lent it to
 Nancy for ?OU? thing. Humphrey had not signed the retention order. And the=
 thing was junked with its negative when it came back to film library, Alan=
 Hanson nearly went through the roof, because you know all those artists ar=
e important. And they were all in
 their studios talking about their work."</span></p>=20

 both as a painter and then later developed AARON -- AI computer based art.=
 I am currently doing research for the Trust. Based on the Trust archives, =
we know Cohen appeared on BBC TV and radio. We are trying to determine if t=
hese appearances are still extant.
 What type of information would you need in order to determine if you have =
any film or audio? In some cases we only have a reference alluding to an in=
terview. But we do have a couple typed up documents that looks like TV tran=
scripts. One of the transcripts

 it is not dated we suspect it belongs to CTAM 42905 tape. And that PROJECT=
