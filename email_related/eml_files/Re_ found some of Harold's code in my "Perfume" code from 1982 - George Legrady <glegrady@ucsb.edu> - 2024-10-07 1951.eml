By the way, I will continue to search for Harold=E2=80=99s printout =
codes. The problem is that we went through those boxes pretty fast =
without the time to actually look in-depth but as I am now looking for =
my own historical materials, who knows what I may come across. This code =
printout that I sent you I found in my tenure package case, so things =
may get misfiled.=20

Very best,=20

George

>>> Sorry it took so long to scan the printed code pages. To give a =
background. I met Harold in August 1981 through his studio assistant =
Jeff Greenberg. Harold generously gave me access to his computer and =
studio and I was in the studio from around September 1981 to possibly =
1984 but in-between in 1982 desktop computers appeared so by 1984 I had =
access to desktop computing. I learned C language and Berkeley Unix on =
Harold=E2=80=99s system. I am not sure but I may have been the only =
artist who was given access. In the studio there were multiple terminals =
and I was assigned to one. Harold had his, and Jeff had his. During this =
period, I was visiting faculty in the art / photography program at Cal =
Arts, and at some point Becky arranged to have me teach a photography =
course at MiraCosta College. (thank you Becky)
>>>=20

1982. It took me a while to figure out how to create an artwork on the =
system (PDP-11 with vector drawn data sent to a Tecktronix 4014). The =
printout has a date of June 17, 1982 but I must have completed the =
visualization somewhat earlier. So interestingly this printout is the =
only remaining documentation of this visual project of mine.=20

Scientific American about thermodynamic diffusion of perfume molecular =
particles which when released from a perfume bottle (limited =
concentration) eventually are evenlly distributed in the next large =
surrounding space. Surprisingly I was fortunate to pick this topic as =
its the basis for how generative AI image synthesis are modelled on =
today. My animation visualization is the only one I wrote on Harold=E2=80=99=
s computer, and it took some time. As I was learning C, Jeff gave me so =
technical guidance.

it documents the interface between writing the code on the PDP-11 and =
how it is then visualized on the Tektronics vector-base green phosfor =

pages to reduce the clutter. Here is a description of the some of the =

everyone,&nbsp;<div><br clear=3D"none"></div><div>Sorry it took so long =
to scan the printed code pages. To give a background. I met Harold in =
August 1981 through his studio assistant Jeff Greenberg. Harold =
generously gave me access to his computer and studio and I was in the =
studio from around September 1981 to possibly 1984 but in-between in =
1982 desktop computers appeared so by 1984 I had access to desktop =
computing. I learned C language and Berkeley Unix on Harold=E2=80=99s =
system. I am not sure but I may have been the only artist who was given =
access. In the studio there were multiple terminals and I was assigned =
to one. Harold had his, and Jeff had his. During this period, I was =
visiting faculty in the art / photography program at Cal Arts, and at =
some point Becky arranged to have me teach a photography course at =
MiraCosta College. (thank you Becky)</div><div><br =
clear=3D"none"></div><div>So I learned C and Unix starting in the fall =
of 1981 and throughout 1982. It took me a while to figure out how to =
create an artwork on the system (PDP-11 with vector drawn data sent to a =
Tecktronix 4014). The printout has a date of June 17, 1982 but I must =
have completed the visualization somewhat earlier. So interestingly this =
printout is the only remaining documentation of this visual project of =
mine.&nbsp;</div><div><br clear=3D"none"></div><div>I came across a =
visualization opportunity reading an article in Scientific American =
about thermodynamic diffusion of perfume molecular particles which when =
released from a perfume bottle (limited concentration) eventually are =
evenlly distributed in the next large surrounding space. Surprisingly I =
was fortunate to pick this topic as its the basis for how generative AI =
image synthesis are modelled on today. My animation visualization is the =
only one I wrote on Harold=E2=80=99s computer, and it took some time. As =
I was learning C, Jeff gave me so technical guidance.</div><div><br =
clear=3D"none"></div><div>The attached code can be of interest to =
Harold=E2=80=99s legacy as it documents the interface between writing =
the code on the PDP-11 and how it is then visualized on the Tektronics =
vector-base green phosfor screen. I have included some of my own code, =
but left out a number of pages to reduce the clutter. Here is a =
