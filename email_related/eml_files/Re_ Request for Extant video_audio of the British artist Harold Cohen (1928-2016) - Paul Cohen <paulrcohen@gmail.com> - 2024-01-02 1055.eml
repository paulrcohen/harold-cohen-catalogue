Hi Mr. Martin, I am writing to thank you for your help and to introduce
myself.  I am Harold Cohen's son and the trustee of the Harold Cohen
Trust.  Harold's work is seeing a resurgence of interest with an exhibition
opening at the Whitney Museum in a few weeks (see here
<https://whitney.org/exhibitions/harold-cohen-aaron> and here
<https://observer.com/2023/12/whitney-show-first-ai-artmaking-software/>)
and another planned in London at the Gazelli Art House
<https://gazelliarthouse.com/artists/harold-cohen/biography/>, which
represents Harold.  Tom Machnik and other members of the Trust are trying
to put together a catalogue raisonne, which is a uge project given that
Harold made work continuously for roughly 70 years! Much of the work
involves hunting for clues -- seeing a painting in a video, or things
Harold said during interviews -- that help us reconstruct a timeline.  We
are also trying to reconstruct computer code stored on old tapes and
disks.  We were thrilled to hear that the BBC might have programmes that
include Harold.  I assure you that we would use these resources for
research purposes only and that we will ask for permission for any other
purpose, such as showing or playing during an exhibition.

Many thanks for your help!

--Paul

th a document inside titled &quot;BARNETT NEWMAN by Harold Cohen&quot;. It =
does not have the same look as a TV transcript but maybe
 a draft for the 1965 TV show. This work is not dated but it begins like th=
is, &quot;In his interview with David Sylvester, Newman gives a very full a=
nd really very technical account of the way his painting developed....&quot=
; Though it is not dated we suspect it belongs
 to CTAM 42905 tape. And that PROJECT NO 5616/0109 is separate TV transmiss=
ion. In any case, we are hoping to resolve these unknowns with your help.<u=

 may have of Cohen or at a minimum determine what is still extant. I provid=
ed the above as it is the most detail we have
 pointing to a specific recording. We are quite sure some of his other even=
ts were also filmed by the BBC. What type of information would you need to =
help us determine what is still extant? If you could advise me further on h=
ow to proceed, that would be most
 appreciated.<u></u><u></u></span></p>
