Guys, I am writing to ask a favor.  A couple of months back, I agreed to
supervise a class project for three undergrads here at Pitt.  The class is
a web development thing where they have to design a web front end and back
end.  I suggested that they build something for Harold's inventory and sent
them a csv file that contains a fraction of Harold's stuff on Art Logic.
To get a grade in the class, they need the work to be evaluated by
professionals in the field.  It would require you to sit through a short
demo and (probably) write a very short evaluation, just a few sentences.

I haven't seen the project yet because they are undergraduates who have
left everything to the last minute.  They are hoping to show it to you --
if you are willing -- next Monday or Tuesday.

My guess is that the work is pretty rudimentary, partly because they are
undergraduates and partly because they are from China and Korea and
communicating with them has been very difficult.

So I don't expect this to be an uplifting experience for any of us, but
they did the work and I'd like them to get a fair evaluation.

Thanks, --Paul
