Hi Tom,

Apologies - to give a bit more context, I'm in the early stages of
developing a documentary on Harold and his journey with AARON, i've become
fascinated with not only how ahead of his time he was in his practice but
also the originality and beauty of the art and how thoughtfully he shared
his thinking with essays and interviews. I'm working on this with Alan
Yentob, the former Head of Arts and Music at the BBC and host/producer of
the BAFTA award winning arts documentary series *Imagine
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(TV_series)>*.

I have read all of the essays, books and content that is in the public
domain about Harold but would welcome a call with yourself to get the
behind the scenes perspective on his collaborations with AARON.

No immediate rush, happy to schedule something for mid-January after the
holiday season is passed? Whatever is most convenient for you.

All the best,
Joel
