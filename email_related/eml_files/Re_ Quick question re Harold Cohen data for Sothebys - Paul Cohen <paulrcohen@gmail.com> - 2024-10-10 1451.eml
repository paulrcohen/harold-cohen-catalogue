Robert, Tom, sorry for being out of touch,I just got to Boston.

I think our best option is to tell the whole story.  If we were stamp
collectors, errors like this would be worth a fortune.  The story as I
understand it leaves no doubt that "2002" was an error.  Here's the
evidence:


   - The left side of the print identifies the work as 03-11-32 (Tom,
   correct me if I misremember the order of the pairs), which means 2003,
   November, 32nd print of the year
   - Another print in the sale was printed at nearly the same time.  On the
   left it says 03-11-35.  On the right it says 2003.
   - Harold compiled a catalog of work in 2004.  In that catalog, the print
   is given the date 2003.
   - We might be able to find an exhibition catalog that shows the print
   and gives it the date 2003.  Tom is looking now.
   - Most importantly, Aaron simply couldn't have made this image in 2002.
   Tom's research shows that potted plants happened in 2003 and, notably,
   shadows didn't appear until the summer of 2003.

All this evidence and Harold's well-known inability to keep track of days
and dates leave no doubt in my mind that "2002" is an error.   The Trust
can stand confidently behind this account.  Far from raising questions
about the dates of the other prints, the research that went into resolving
this anomaly should convince Sotheby's and collectors that we are very
serious about the dates.

--Paul

 what is supplied although the file metadata does say 2003.</div><div><br c=

        <div dir=3D"ltr"><div>Dear Robert,<br clear=3D"none">I looked into =
the matter and the short answer is still the same -- the digital files are =
timestamped 2003 and the print is signed 2002. I did not find any evidence =
to support the idea that the files were some how generated in 2002 instead =
of 2003. I came to this conclusion by examining the all the digital &amp; p=
hysical works from the beginning of 2002 to the end 2003 in chronological o=
rder. Ideally I would lay out a visual timeline so we can see the progressi=
on of AARON&#39;s development over that time. That will take quite a bit of=
 time to put together so I will leave that to a future date. But I did note=
 in my notebook the style and key elements that each of the versions of AAR=
ON produced during the 2002-03 time period. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D=
"none">By doing this, it became quite clear that AARON was not capable of p=
roducing anything in 2002 even remotely close to the plant imagery of 0311-=
32 (i23-3405) in terms of variety and complexity. The earliest it might hav=
e been able to do so would have been very late summer of 2003. Also, the wo=
rk in question (0311-32) &amp; its sister print at Sotheby&#39;s (0311-35) =
both belong to a series of works that were all generated in Oct 2003. And i=
n this series we see portrait works, square works and landscape works all w=
ith the same complexity and similar style of imagery. If we some how put 03=
11-32 in year 2002 then we have to ask well what about its sister print 031=
1-35? And what about all the other works in the series? <br clear=3D"none">=
<br clear=3D"none">In terms of AARON&#39;s early-post-painting-machine phas=
e development there is an obvious deliberate progression. The start of whic=
h seems to coincide with his purchase of a Roland HiFi printer in early 200=
0 along with a switch to Windows NT/2000 around the same time.=C2=A0 The tw=
o works at Sotheby&#39;s express the zenith in terms of AARON&#39;s early-p=
ost-painting-machine phase development. The next phase (2004+) is much diff=
erent as we can see in only 2004 work we have at Sotheby&#39;s. <br clear=
=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Of course Harold is not here to ask what happe=
ned. I rather think he signed 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002. I don&#39;t kn=
ow what the implications of this are. I hope it is like the mint minting a =
coin and making a mistake impressing the wrong year. And in turn by doing s=
o created something rare and more valuable as because by adding human error=
 this work truly is &quot;unique.&quot;<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none=
