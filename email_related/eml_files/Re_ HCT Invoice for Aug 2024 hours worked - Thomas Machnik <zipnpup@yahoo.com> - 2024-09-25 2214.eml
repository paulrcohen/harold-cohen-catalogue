 Hi Paul,Thanks for the list of items. Regarding a call to catch up, I'd li=
ke to keep Thursday morning open in case there is something urgent from Mil=
a. But tentatively I could take a call Thursday between 1p to 4p Calif time=
 . If that doesn't work, similar time for Friday. Let me know if either tim=
e works,

Tom

Hi Paul,We are in the final stretch to sending the work off for the Sotheby=
 Auction. The photoshoot went well with the photographer Pablo Mason. Becau=
se the works are behind plexiglass it was a bit of a challenge to get the l=
ighting right. Fortunately had plenty of black draping fabric to setup arou=
nd the studio to reduce the reflection. Once he got it right I saw the firs=
t photo and it looked fabulous. With the right lighting it looks even bette=
r than with the ambient light in the studio. It was a pleasure working with=
 him. If we need someone in the future I would not hesitate to recommend hi=
m again.=20

I am waiting for the final pickup time for the work but it is tentatively s=
et for sometime this Wednesday.=C2=A0 The works are basically ready to go. =
I will check them one more time tomorrow. I am hoping to get the link to Pa=
blo's photos tomorrow so I can put them into the shipment list document tha=
t needs to be signed upon pickup.

This has been a real push to make this happen. I haven't even had a moment =
to look at Roger's print. He showed it to me when I picked it up last Monda=
y and the brief moment I saw it, I was happily surprise that it looked quit=
e close to the original. I will need to really look at it closely though. A=
ssuming all goes well and no more immediate concerns with Gazelli, I will l=
ook at the Roger's print this week. I will also pull a drawing for George L=
egrady finally. And see what can be done regarding work for the Whitney fol=
k.=20

I didn't keep track of my hours related to Sotheby. When I started I didn't=
 think it would have ballooned into the time consuming activity that it did=
. In a previous email you mentioned this was a lesson learned and you we ev=
en considering pulling the plug at the very last minute. I agree with you t=
hat at time point it would do more harm than good to pull the plug at this =
late stage. Let's see how the auction goes. I sure hope it is a success. An=
d I understand that part of the strategy is to sway the Tate into buying a =
software version possibly. If that happens, then certainly Sotheby is a suc=
cess.

A while back in the summer we talked about various things. One of them was =
an increase in pay. I have added an increase on this invoice. The last time=
 I had a raise was 2016. I calculated the inflation rate from 2016 to 2024 =
using https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2016?amount=3D1 which clai=
ms today $45.94 is the equivalent of $35 dollars in 2016. My new invoice ra=
te is a bit higher at $50/hr. I hope this doesn't break the bank but I am d=
oing much more and have much more responsibility than back in 2016. There a=
re times I am basically working around the clock. I am not saying this as a=
 complaint as I am committed to improving the legacy of Harold/AARON and wo=
uld have left a long time ago if I didn't enjoy being involved. It does see=
m like an exciting time and I am hoping the trust continues to outperform o=
ur expectations. I hope our relationship with Mila remains solid and that G=
azelli continues to be successful. I recently learned I am no longer eligib=
le for health care from California due to COVID winding down. The health ca=
re was basically free. Next month, I will need to sign up for health care. =
Previously, you had mentioned about paying for my health care. I really don=
't know how much that will be yet but I hope the Trust will consider paying=
 for my health care.=20

Tom

for the Sotheby Auction. The photoshoot went well with the photographer Pab=
lo Mason. Because the works are behind plexiglass it was a bit of a challen=
ge to get the lighting right. Fortunately had plenty of black draping fabri=
c to setup around the studio to reduce the reflection. Once he got it right=
 I saw the first photo and it looked fabulous. With the right lighting it l=
ooks even better than with the ambient light in the studio. It was a pleasu=
re working with him. If we need someone in the future I would not hesitate =
to recommend him again. <br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br clear=

 the work but it is tentatively set for sometime this Wednesday.&nbsp; The =
works are basically ready to go. I will check them one more time tomorrow. =
I am hoping to get the link to Pablo's photos tomorrow so I can put them in=

This has been a real push to make this happen. I haven't even had a moment =
to look at Roger's print. He showed it to me when I picked it up last Monda=
y and the brief moment I saw it, I was happily surprise that it looked quit=
e close to the original. I will need to really look at it closely though. A=
ssuming all goes well and no more immediate concerns with Gazelli, I will l=
ook at the Roger's print this week. I will also pull a drawing for George L=
egrady finally. And see what can be done regarding work for the Whitney fol=
k. <br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br clear=3D"none"></div><div =
dir=3D"ltr">I didn't keep track of my hours related to Sotheby. When I star=
ted I didn't think it would have ballooned into the time consuming activity=
 that it did. In a previous email you mentioned this was a lesson learned a=
nd you we even considering pulling the plug at the very last minute. I agre=
e with you that at time point it would do more harm than good to pull the p=
lug at this late stage. Let's see how the auction goes. I sure hope it is a=
 success. And I understand that part of the strategy is to sway the Tate in=
to buying a software version possibly. If that happens, then certainly Soth=
eby is a success.<br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br clear=3D"non=

s things. One of them was an increase in pay. I have added an increase on t=
his invoice. The last time I had a raise was 2016. I calculated the inflati=
on rate from 2016 to 2024 using <a shape=3D"rect" href=3D"https://www.in201=
3dollars.com/us/inflation/2016?amount=3D1" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blan=

ims today $45.94 is the equivalent of $35 dollars in 2016. My new invoice r=
ate is a bit higher at $50/hr. I hope this doesn't break the bank but I am =
doing much more and have much more responsibility than back in 2016. There =
are times I am basically working around the clock. I am not saying this as =
a complaint as I am committed to improving the legacy of Harold/AARON and w=
ould have left a long time ago if I didn't enjoy being involved. It does se=
em like an exciting time and I am hoping the trust continues to outperform =
our expectations. I hope our relationship with Mila remains solid and that =
Gazelli continues to be successful. I recently learned I am no longer eligi=
ble for health care from California due to COVID winding down. The health c=
are was basically free. Next month, I will need to sign up for health care.=
 Previously, you had mentioned about paying for my health care. I really do=
n't know how much that will be yet but I hope the Trust will consider payin=
g for my health care. <br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br clear=
