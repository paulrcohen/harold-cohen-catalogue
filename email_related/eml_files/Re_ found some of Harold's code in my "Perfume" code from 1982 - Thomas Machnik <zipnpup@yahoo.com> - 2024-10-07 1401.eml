Download full resolution imagesAvailable until Nov 5, 2024hi Paul and every=
one,=C2=A0
Sorry it took so long to scan the printed code pages. To give a background.=
 I met Harold in August 1981 through his studio assistant Jeff Greenberg. H=
arold generously gave me access to his computer and studio and I was in the=
 studio from around September 1981 to possibly 1984 but in-between in 1982 =
desktop computers appeared so by 1984 I had access to desktop computing. I =
learned C language and Berkeley Unix on Harold=E2=80=99s system. I am not s=
ure but I may have been the only artist who was given access. In the studio=
 there were multiple terminals and I was assigned to one. Harold had his, a=
nd Jeff had his. During this period, I was visiting faculty in the art / ph=
otography program at Cal Arts, and at some point Becky arranged to have me =
teach a photography course at MiraCosta College. (thank you Becky)
So I learned C and Unix starting in the fall of 1981 and throughout 1982. I=
t took me a while to figure out how to create an artwork on the system (PDP=
-11 with vector drawn data sent to a Tecktronix 4014). The printout has a d=
ate of June 17, 1982 but I must have completed the visualization somewhat e=
arlier. So interestingly this printout is the only remaining documentation =
of this visual project of mine.=C2=A0
I came across a visualization opportunity reading an article in Scientific =
American about thermodynamic diffusion of perfume molecular particles which=
 when released from a perfume bottle (limited concentration) eventually are=
 evenlly distributed in the next large surrounding space. Surprisingly I wa=
s fortunate to pick this topic as its the basis for how generative AI image=
 synthesis are modelled on today. My animation visualization is the only on=
e I wrote on Harold=E2=80=99s computer, and it took some time. As I was lea=
rning C, Jeff gave me so technical guidance.
The attached code can be of interest to Harold=E2=80=99s legacy as it docum=
ents the interface between writing the code on the PDP-11 and how it is the=
n visualized on the Tektronics vector-base green phosfor screen. I have inc=
luded some of my own code, but left out a number of pages to reduce the clu=
tter. Here is a description of the some of the pages:=C2=A0
P.48 Gives a list of the various ways by which a dot or line would be sent =
from the PDP-11 to the TekTronix 4014 vector screen
P.49  Has some ways by which to send the data to the TekTronix.=C2=A0
P.50-60 Code that draws some of my visualization to the TekTronix.=C2=A0
P.61-62 Include functions that were written by Harold that I was given to u=
se. Interesting is how the random function was further randomized by dividi=
ng the returned rand() value with the prime number=C2=A0https://en.wikipedi=
a.org/wiki/2,147,483,647.=C2=A0
Other useful functions where the xpolar, ypolar, and the dist().
P.63 was the =E2=80=9Cmake=E2=80=9D function by which to compile all the fi=
les to generate the visualization.=C2=A0
------
The Noise-Signal series I produced between 1986-1990 were the next C langua=
ge code-based works I created starting in 1986, when the pixel / raster bas=
ed AT&T Targa based system became available. Most of these were printed on =
a unique Fuji Inkjet printer located near UCLA:=C2=A0https://www.mat.ucsb.e=
du/~g.legrady/glWeb/Projects/noise/noisesignal.pdf
Patrick Frank, an art historian recently published a book =E2=80=9CArt of t=
he 1980s: As if the Digital Mattered=E2=80=9D in which he discusses these w=
orks of mine.=C2=A0
The Centre Pompidou just acquired a few, and there will be an exhibition of=
 them opening December 12 at RCM Gallery in Paris.=C2=A0
Very best,=C2=A0

></div></a>hi Paul and everyone,&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Sorry it took so =
long to scan the printed code pages. To give a background. I met Harold in =
August 1981 through his studio assistant Jeff Greenberg. Harold generously =
gave me access to his computer and studio and I was in the studio from arou=
nd September 1981 to possibly 1984 but in-between in 1982 desktop computers=
 appeared so by 1984 I had access to desktop computing. I learned C languag=
e and Berkeley Unix on Harold=E2=80=99s system. I am not sure but I may hav=
e been the only artist who was given access. In the studio there were multi=
ple terminals and I was assigned to one. Harold had his, and Jeff had his. =
During this period, I was visiting faculty in the art / photography program=
 at Cal Arts, and at some point Becky arranged to have me teach a photograp=
hy course at MiraCosta College. (thank you Becky)</div><div><br></div><div>=
So I learned C and Unix starting in the fall of 1981 and throughout 1982. I=
t took me a while to figure out how to create an artwork on the system (PDP=
-11 with vector drawn data sent to a Tecktronix 4014). The printout has a d=
ate of June 17, 1982 but I must have completed the visualization somewhat e=
arlier. So interestingly this printout is the only remaining documentation =
of this visual project of mine.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I came acros=
s a visualization opportunity reading an article in Scientific American abo=
ut thermodynamic diffusion of perfume molecular particles which when releas=
ed from a perfume bottle (limited concentration) eventually are evenlly dis=
tributed in the next large surrounding space. Surprisingly I was fortunate =
to pick this topic as its the basis for how generative AI image synthesis a=
re modelled on today. My animation visualization is the only one I wrote on=
 Harold=E2=80=99s computer, and it took some time. As I was learning C, Jef=
f gave me so technical guidance.</div><div><br></div><div>The attached code=
 can be of interest to Harold=E2=80=99s legacy as it documents the interfac=
e between writing the code on the PDP-11 and how it is then visualized on t=
he Tektronics vector-base green phosfor screen. I have included some of my =
own code, but left out a number of pages to reduce the clutter. Here is a d=
escription of the some of the pages:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>P.48<sp=

inter located near UCLA:&nbsp;<a rel=3D"nofollow noopener noreferrer" targe=
