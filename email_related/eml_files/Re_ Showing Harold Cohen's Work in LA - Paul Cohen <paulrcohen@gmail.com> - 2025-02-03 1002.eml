Hi Neil, thanks for getting in touch.  I agree that Harold's work  would be
a good fit, and appreciate you thinking of showing something, but time is
too short and the studio is fully occupied with moving a lot of work in
preparation for a catalog raisonne project, so we must decline.

I am sorry!

--Paul
