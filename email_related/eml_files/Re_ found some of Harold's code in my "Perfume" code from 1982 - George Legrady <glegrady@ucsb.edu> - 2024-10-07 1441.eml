>> Sorry it took so long to scan the printed code pages. To give a =
background. I met Harold in August 1981 through his studio assistant =
Jeff Greenberg. Harold generously gave me access to his computer and =
studio and I was in the studio from around September 1981 to possibly =
1984 but in-between in 1982 desktop computers appeared so by 1984 I had =
access to desktop computing. I learned C language and Berkeley Unix on =
Harold=E2=80=99s system. I am not sure but I may have been the only =
artist who was given access. In the studio there were multiple terminals =
and I was assigned to one. Harold had his, and Jeff had his. During this =
period, I was visiting faculty in the art / photography program at Cal =
Arts, and at some point Becky arranged to have me teach a photography =
course at MiraCosta College. (thank you Becky)

system (PDP-11 with vector drawn data sent to a Tecktronix 4014). The =

its the basis for how generative AI image synthesis are modelled on =
today. My animation visualization is the only one I wrote on Harold=E2=80=99=

technical guidance.

I was able to take a quick glance at it and found it quite interesting. =
We have some older code with this mysterious call to a routine named =
"plot" but no code definition for plot. In the code you sent, plot seems =
to be used to send commands to the Tektronix display. This could provide =
clues on how and what these commands were used needed in the earlier =

everyone,&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Sorry it took so long to scan the =
printed code pages. To give a background. I met Harold in August 1981 =
through his studio assistant Jeff Greenberg. Harold generously gave me =
access to his computer and studio and I was in the studio from around =
September 1981 to possibly 1984 but in-between in 1982 desktop computers =
appeared so by 1984 I had access to desktop computing. I learned C =
language and Berkeley Unix on Harold=E2=80=99s system. I am not sure but =
I may have been the only artist who was given access. In the studio =
there were multiple terminals and I was assigned to one. Harold had his, =
and Jeff had his. During this period, I was visiting faculty in the art =
/ photography program at Cal Arts, and at some point Becky arranged to =
have me teach a photography course at MiraCosta College. (thank you =
Becky)</div><div><br></div><div>So I learned C and Unix starting in the =
fall of 1981 and throughout 1982. It took me a while to figure out how =
to create an artwork on the system (PDP-11 with vector drawn data sent =
to a Tecktronix 4014). The printout has a date of June 17, 1982 but I =
must have completed the visualization somewhat earlier. So interestingly =
this printout is the only remaining documentation of this visual project =
of mine.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I came across a visualization =
opportunity reading an article in Scientific American about =
thermodynamic diffusion of perfume molecular particles which when =
released from a perfume bottle (limited concentration) eventually are =
evenlly distributed in the next large surrounding space. Surprisingly I =
was fortunate to pick this topic as its the basis for how generative AI =
image synthesis are modelled on today. My animation visualization is the =
only one I wrote on Harold=E2=80=99s computer, and it took some time. As =
I was learning C, Jeff gave me so technical =
guidance.</div><div><br></div><div>The attached code can be of interest =
to Harold=E2=80=99s legacy as it documents the interface between writing =
the code on the PDP-11 and how it is then visualized on the Tektronics =
vector-base green phosfor screen. I have included some of my own code, =
but left out a number of pages to reduce the clutter. Here is a =
description of the some of the =
pages:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>P.48<span style=3D"white-space:pre;"=
