 Hi Paul,Thanks, that is a good question. Unfortunately, if there was an em=
ail, it has been deleted. I do see what you mean about rim. Thanks for poin=
ting that out. I am now reading through the existing emails from around the=
 same time which happens to be around 911. =C2=A0Apparently Harold had a pi=
nched nerve in need to surgery. There was an email from Deb Hendel and I th=
ought maybe SANY0005 was part of their collection. But the email from Deb H=
endel was to simply convey to Harold that Bob, her and their family were al=
l okay.
There are many emails related to a show I didn=E2=80=99t know about previou=
sly scheduled for October 2001 in Paderborn, Germany =E2=80=94 Heinz Nixdor=
f MuseumsForum. I don=E2=80=99t see this listed in the bio and never heard =
Harold mention this show to me. Harold was to go to the opening but was una=
ble due to surgery to relieve a pinched nerve. The details of the show incl=
udes projecting AARON onto a very large multi-meter screen, run a looping v=
ideo of Harold talking about AARON. Initially, KCAT was to be running but H=
arold sent an updated version. There was a lengthy discussion on printing w=
orks onsite making them available for sale. I am still reading through the =
emails to determine if printing onsite for purchase by museum goers actuall=
y happened or not. There was discussion of selling smaller works that could=
 be rolled in a tube and sold for $100 a piece. There are also many emails =
related to the difficulties of printing quality prints. =C2=A0The Museum ha=
s a link to the show at=C2=A0https://www.hnf.de/ausstellungen/rueckblick/ku=
nst-aus-dem-computer.html. They claim that 7 physical works were shown. May=
be SANY0005 was one of them. I am working on reaching out to the museum. It=
 would also be good to know if SANY005 was one of the ones show and if not =
what was shown and do they have any Cohen/AARON works. But it would also be=
 good to know if they still have a runnable version of AARON.=C2=A0
