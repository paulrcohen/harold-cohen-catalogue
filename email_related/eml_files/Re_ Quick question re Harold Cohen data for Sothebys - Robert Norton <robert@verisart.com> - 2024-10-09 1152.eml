Thanks Tom for double checking all this.  Appreciate that all this takes =
time and it=E2=80=99s sometimes hard to determine what happened so long =
ago.

Regarding this work, we now have two options:

1) We create a new certificate for the print and change the date from =
2002 to 2003.  The problem with this is that the collector would receive =
the print and may then ask why the year says 2002 whereas the record =
says 2003 and this may create further confusion and invite further =
scrutiny regarding dates written on other prints.  I think we would want =
to avoid this as we are looking to build a trusted market for this =
works.  We would also need to destroy the already minted NFT which =
states a production year of 2002 which is what is supplied although the =
file metadata does say 2003.

2) We leave the certificate for the print as it stands which states it =
was produced in 2002.  We add a note to the certificate for the NFT to =
say this is the earliest known file the estate has for this work and say =
that the descriptor file was not saved until 2003.  The benefit with =
this is we don't have to re-mint or re-issue the NFT or the certificate =
and we can simply amend the certificate for the NFT to reflect the =
above.

I suspect there may be other cases we come across when we put together =
the catalog raisonne and it may be better to include all works together =
in a series of changes the estate agrees upon than to introduce all this =
know on the eve, so to speak, of the selling exhibition with =
Sotheby=E2=80=99s.

We will do whatever you think is best but from our perspective we think =
Option 2 is preferable at this stage.

Grateful for your thoughts and guidance on this.

Best

examining the all the digital & physical works from the beginning of =
2002 to the end 2003 in chronological order. Ideally I would lay out a =
visual timeline so we can see the progression of AARON's development =
over that time. That will take quite a bit of time to put together so I =
will leave that to a future date. But I did note in my notebook the =
style and key elements that each of the versions of AARON produced =
during the 2002-03 time period.=20

0311-32 (i23-3405) in terms of variety and complexity. The earliest it =
might have been able to do so would have been very late summer of 2003. =
Also, the work in question (0311-32) & its sister print at Sotheby's =
(0311-35) both belong to a series of works that were all generated in =
Oct 2003. And in this series we see portrait works, square works and =
landscape works all with the same complexity and similar style of =
imagery. If we some how put 0311-32 in year 2002 then we have to ask =
well what about its sister print 0311-35? And what about all the other =
works in the series?=20
>=20
> In terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase development =
there is an obvious deliberate progression. The start of which seems to =
coincide with his purchase of a Roland HiFi printer in early 2000 along =
with a switch to Windows NT/2000 around the same time.  The two works at =
Sotheby's express the zenith in terms of AARON's =
early-post-painting-machine phase development. The next phase (2004+) is =
much different as we can see in only 2004 work we have at Sotheby's.=20
>=20

signed 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002. I don't know what the implications =
of this are. I hope it is like the mint minting a coin and making a =
mistake impressing the wrong year. And in turn by doing so created =
something rare and more valuable as because by adding human error this =
work truly is "unique."

Yes, meaning the physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file =

        <div dir=3D"ltr" data-setdir=3D"false"><div>Dear Robert,<br>I =
looked into the matter and the short answer is still the same -- the =
digital files are timestamped 2003 and the print is signed 2002. I did =
not find any evidence to support the idea that the files were some how =
generated in 2002 instead of 2003. I came to this conclusion by =
examining the all the digital &amp; physical works from the beginning of =
2002 to the end 2003 in chronological order. Ideally I would lay out a =
visual timeline so we can see the progression of AARON's development =
over that time. That will take quite a bit of time to put together so I =
will leave that to a future date. But I did note in my notebook the =
style and key elements that each of the versions of AARON produced =
during the 2002-03 time period. <br><br>By doing this, it became quite =
clear that AARON was not capable of producing anything in 2002 even =
remotely close to the plant imagery of 0311-32 (i23-3405) in terms of =
variety and complexity. The earliest it might have been able to do so =
would have been very late summer of 2003. Also, the work in question =
(0311-32) &amp; its sister print at Sotheby's (0311-35) both belong to a =
series of works that were all generated in Oct 2003. And in this series =
we see portrait works, square works and landscape works all with the =
same complexity and similar style of imagery. If we some how put 0311-32 =
in year 2002 then we have to ask well what about its sister print =
0311-35? And what about all the other works in the series? <br><br>In =
terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase development there is =
an obvious deliberate progression. The start of which seems to coincide =
with his purchase of a Roland HiFi printer in early 2000 along with a =
switch to Windows NT/2000 around the same time.&nbsp; The two works at =
Sotheby's express the zenith in terms of AARON's =
early-post-painting-machine phase development. The next phase (2004+) is =
much different as we can see in only 2004 work we have at Sotheby's. =
<br><br>Of course Harold is not here to ask what happened. I rather =
think he signed 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002. I don't know what the =
implications of this are. I hope it is like the mint minting a coin and =
making a mistake impressing the wrong year. And in turn by doing so =
created something rare and more valuable as because by adding human =
error this work truly is =
"unique."<br><br>Tom</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div>

Since the=20

question, "How is this possible?"</span> I know you probably want a =
quick yes or no answer. If that is true then the quick is answer yes. =
Yes, meaning the physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file =
timestamp is 2003. But this would certainly suggest an error. Did Tom =
write down the information incorrectly? Is that the error? No. The =
timestamp for the aa file is 2003 and the signed print is 2002. <br =

incorrectly.&nbsp; Two, he signed the print correctly. But, we don't =
know why the generated work seems to be in the future. If the second =
scenario is true, how could it be true? Maybe, the version of AARON =
