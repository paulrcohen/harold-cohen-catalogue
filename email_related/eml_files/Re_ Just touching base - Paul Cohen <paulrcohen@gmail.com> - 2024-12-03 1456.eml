Hi Bob and Debbie, how nice to hear from you!  I was thinking of you both
last week because, yes, I went to England for the opening of Electric
Dreams and also to meet with Mila and her team at the Gazelli gallery.  A
commercial sponsor might be interested in underwriting the touring of the
Whitney show.  Very early stages of discussion, but they seem quite
excited.  As it happened, Bre Pettis (the plotter guy) was also in London.
Is Zach still enjoying his work there?

Did you and the art survive the twin hurricanes?  I think one of them hit
your part of Florida pretty hard, didn't it?

I can't remember whether you met my daughter and her fiancee at the Whitney
event.  They got married last month, very lovely ceremony with a small
crowd of friends from college and their respective labs.  Allegra is
finishing a tour or duty at DARPA and planning her next gig.

Last week I bought a house in Boston so I can be closer to Allegra and
Hitch.  I was at the Courtauld Institute during the closing looking at the
Cezannes, but thanks to Docusign it all worked!  I'll sell the Pittsburgh
place in the spring.  No idea whether I'll remain as a prof.  The Trust
takes so much time but it doesn't pay me anything, so I'm kinda stuck
between a rock and a hard place!

As to drawings, we have a ridiculously big stack of them in San Diego and
I'd be happy to send some (I'll need your address).  I also have five from
each plotter that were signed by Christiane, Bre and me.  I'll send one of
each of these if you're interested.

Really good to hear from you, thanks for keeping in touch! --P
