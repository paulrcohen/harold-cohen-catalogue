can=E2=80=99t make out the name exactly.  I know my mom remembers this lect=
ure so I
can ask her.  Mima also thanked Mr. Ito (again, not super sure), who is the
president of the art department, as well as the Committee of International
Relations (?) for inviting and helping fund the special lecture.  The theme
of the lecture was =E2=80=9Csomthing something=E2=80=A6Imagination in Art=
=E2=80=9D or something
like that? I can=E2=80=99t make out the first part.  I didn=E2=80=99t liste=
n to the whole
lecture, but it sounds great! The part in second video at about 48 min in
during the Q &A is so interesting!

Can I share the video with my mom to see if she remembers anything else
pertinent?

 made the effort to convert it from tape and share the link but we have acc=
ess now. The lecture is in English and sounds like it is being translated a=
s he goes through the lecture. If you have some time can you listen at leas=
t to the beginning where they are speaking Japanese and where I assume they=
 are introducing HC. And can you give me any important details like where t=
hey are. Who invited him. Why they are there etc. Or any other info you may=

? Also when <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you say &quot;the version that was sol=

g this was the version that ran at the 2002 exhibit? <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=

t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; display at the 2002 exhibit?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The des=
ktop computer is still in my lab, however, it doesn&#39;t work.<br>&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt; I attach the picture to this mail.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt; My first visit was in December, 2000 around the presidential elect=
ion,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At that time Harold said he was preparing a commer=
cially available <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; version of AARON.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After I came back to Japan, I found an advertisement o=
f the product <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I bought it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rel=
ated information is still on the web. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http:=
//www.kurzweilcyberart.com/" target=3D"_blank">http://www.kurzweilcyberart.=
com/</a><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Its price was around $20. (You might be known =
about this version of <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AARON.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We u=
sed the software or the picture that was generated by the software<br>&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt; to introduce &quot;who Harold is&quot; at our exhibition on Dec=
. 2001.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The talk on July 2002 at Fu=

t;&gt; When you said the projection was 12 by 6 meters, that is quite <br>&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impressive! Thank you for sharing how Harold was an imp=
ortant <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; friend to you both. I hope you can find aud=
io or video of Harold <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cohen.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; U=

cause around year 2000, video equipment was to alittle bigger and <br>&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt; hard to carry.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =
Ah so we did meet at the studio and you probably have some of <br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt; Harold&#39;s works too.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
 I have some of his artworks.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The biggest one used to b=

in 2002.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I coordinated the =

;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for AARON on the flyer, it was the ver=
