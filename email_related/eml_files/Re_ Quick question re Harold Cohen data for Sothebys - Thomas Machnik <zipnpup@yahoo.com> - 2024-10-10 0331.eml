 Hi Robert,
Well, we have a dilemma. I actual see two additional options. I don't neces=
sarily have the final word as we should get Paul's input. In order of my pr=
eference from most preferred to least, I list them below. Just want to note=
 that knowing what I now know, I would not have sent this one.=20

Preference from most preferred to least1) Pull the work from the auction2) =
Sell the print but without the NFT or sell NFT without print
3) Use your 2nd option with a minor changeYour second option is to leave th=
e certificate as is but add a note. I suggest changing the note on the cert=
ificate to, "this is the earliest known file the estate has for this work."=
=C2=A0 I would leave out, "the descriptor file was not saved until 2003". W=
e might consider, "the earliest known descriptor file for this work has a 2=
003 timestamp."
4) is the one about changing the certificate to 2003. This is probably the =
most appropriate thing to do because it reflects reality. But we are concer=
ned about the implications for the collectors. And because of this, I inclu=
ded the option of pulling the work from the auction or selling the print bu=
t not the NFT with it.=20

Honestly, except for #1 I am a bit uncomfortable with all of them. Maybe in=
 general an auction is not the proper venue for selling works that include =
signing errors. Maybe in those cases it would be better to have a one-on-on=
e conversation with the collector on the reality and provide a more complet=
e story of the work. And maybe this is what we should do regarding this wor=
k.

I do have an additional concern regarding this work (with respect to genera=
ting a certificate) in that we have some evidence that a 2/3 and 3/3 might =
have been made and as of yet, I do not know how they were signed. I do know=
 that in our 2002 - 2004 catalog (the one I showed you when you visited)...=
 in there the work is documented as being 2003. So again everything points =
to the work being 2003 and that Harold made an error.=20

If we keep the claim of the print as being signed as 2002 without explanati=
on, internally we will have implications as well. And these implications ma=
y actually out way the concern of the implications related to collectors. F=
or example, if we want to make our 2002 - 2004 catalog in its current or ex=
panded form more widely available, the catalog will not jive with the certi=
ficate. And in any other instance whereby Harold referred to this work (thi=
s includes multiple Powerpoint presentations, speeches and the like) the co=
nfusion is only exasperated due to that one number in pencil being written =
as a 2 and not a 3.
I know this is on the eve of the auction and I would have preferred I didn'=
t send this one. And like you mention though not in these exact terms, this=
 work belongs to the misfits group. I don't know we can pull this work on t=
he eve of the auction but that is my preference. But I am open to hear what=
 Paul things about all this.
Tom

 Thanks Tom for double checking all this. =C2=A0Appreciate that all this ta=
kes time and it=E2=80=99s sometimes hard to determine what happened so long=
 ago.
Regarding this work, we now have two options:
1) We create a new certificate for the print and change the date from 2002 =
to 2003. =C2=A0The problem with this is that the collector would receive th=
e print and may then ask why the year says 2002 whereas the record says 200=
3 and this may create further confusion and invite further scrutiny regardi=
ng dates written on other prints. =C2=A0I think we would want to avoid this=
 as we are looking to build a trusted market for this works. =C2=A0We would=
 also need to destroy the already minted NFT which states a production year=
 of 2002 which is what is supplied although the file metadata does say 2003=
.
2) We leave the certificate for the print as it stands which states it was =
produced in 2002. =C2=A0We add a note to the certificate for the NFT to say=
 this is the earliest known file the estate has for this work and say that =
the descriptor file was not saved until 2003. =C2=A0The benefit with this i=
s we don't have to re-mint or re-issue the NFT or the certificate and we ca=
n simply amend the certificate for the NFT to reflect the above.
I suspect there may be other cases we come across when we put together the =
catalog raisonne and it may be better to include all works together in a se=
ries of changes the estate agrees upon than to introduce all this know on t=
he eve, so to speak, of the selling exhibition with Sotheby=E2=80=99s.
We will do whatever you think is best but from our perspective we think Opt=
ion 2 is preferable at this stage.
Grateful for your thoughts and guidance on this.
Best

 Dear Robert,
I looked into the matter and the short answer is still the same -- the digi=
tal files are timestamped 2003 and the print is signed 2002. I did not find=
 any evidence to support the idea that the files were some how generated in=
 2002 instead of 2003. I came to this conclusion by examining the all the d=
igital & physical works from the beginning of 2002 to the end 2003 in chron=
ological order. Ideally I would lay out a visual timeline so we can see the=
 progression of AARON's development over that time. That will take quite a =
bit of time to put together so I will leave that to a future date. But I di=
d note in my notebook the style and key elements that each of the versions =
of AARON produced during the 2002-03 time period.=20

By doing this, it became quite clear that AARON was not capable of producin=
g anything in 2002 even remotely close to the plant imagery of 0311-32 (i23=
-3405) in terms of variety and complexity. The earliest it might have been =
able to do so would have been very late summer of 2003. Also, the work in q=
uestion (0311-32) & its sister print at Sotheby's (0311-35) both belong to =
a series of works that were all generated in Oct 2003. And in this series w=
e see portrait works, square works and landscape works all with the same co=
mplexity and similar style of imagery. If we some how put 0311-32 in year 2=
002 then we have to ask well what about its sister print 0311-35? And what =
about all the other works in the series?=20

In terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase development there is =
an obvious deliberate progression. The start of which seems to coincide wit=
h his purchase of a Roland HiFi printer in early 2000 along with a switch t=
o Windows NT/2000 around the same time.=C2=A0 The two works at Sotheby's ex=
press the zenith in terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase deve=
lopment. The next phase (2004+) is much different as we can see in only 200=
4 work we have at Sotheby's.=20

Of course Harold is not here to ask what happened. I rather think he signed=
 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002. I don't know what the implications of this =
are. I hope it is like the mint minting a coin and making a mistake impress=
ing the wrong year. And in turn by doing so created something rare and more=
 valuable as because by adding human error this work truly is "unique."

Just to clarify Sotheby=E2=80=99s are not asking about the print as this sp=

Hi Robert,When it comes to Harold there rarely is a quick answer. Since the=
 physical print date precedes the aa file timestamp by one year, that begs =
the question, "How is this possible?" I know you probably want a quick yes =
or no answer. If that is true then the quick is answer yes. Yes, meaning th=
e physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file timestamp is 2003. But th=
is would certainly suggest an error. Did Tom write down the information inc=
orrectly? Is that the error? No. The timestamp for the aa file is 2003 and =
the signed print is 2002.=20

It seems like we have one of two scenarios. One, Harold signed the physical=
 print incorrectly.=C2=A0 Two, he signed the print correctly. But, we don't=
 know why the generated work seems to be in the future. If the second scena=
rio is true, how could it be true? Maybe, the version of AARON Harold used =
was from 2002 and that he simply ran it in 2003.=20

We had a situation at the Whitney this past year whereby all the work was g=
enerated in 2023 and then plotted in 2024. However, the version of AARON ge=
nerating the work was from 2001. We may think these are 2024 works because =
they were plotted in 2024. But maybe in the mind of the artist they are rea=
lly 2001 works because all the works were already fixed as potentials in th=
e 2001.

I'm not sure if the second scenario can be confirmed or not as I never thou=
ght about this before. When I go to the studio Tuesday, I will see what I c=
an find. I also sent a message to Cohen's 2002-2003 assistant and waiting f=
or her thoughts and this matter.

Hi Tom

Sothebys have flagged this work as the production year says 2002 but the de=
scription of the file says the file was created in 2003.=C2=A0=20

Can you confirm this is correct?

Thanks

        <div dir=3D"ltr"><div>Dear Robert,<br clear=3D"none">I looked into =
the matter and the short answer is still the same -- the digital files are =
timestamped 2003 and the print is signed 2002. I did not find any evidence =
to support the idea that the files were some how generated in 2002 instead =
of 2003. I came to this conclusion by examining the all the digital &amp; p=
hysical works from the beginning of 2002 to the end 2003 in chronological o=
rder. Ideally I would lay out a visual timeline so we can see the progressi=
on of AARON's development over that time. That will take quite a bit of tim=
e to put together so I will leave that to a future date. But I did note in =
my notebook the style and key elements that each of the versions of AARON p=
roduced during the 2002-03 time period. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"non=

cing anything in 2002 even remotely close to the plant imagery of 0311-32 (=
i23-3405) in terms of variety and complexity. The earliest it might have be=
en able to do so would have been very late summer of 2003. Also, the work i=
n question (0311-32) &amp; its sister print at Sotheby's (0311-35) both bel=
ong to a series of works that were all generated in Oct 2003. And in this s=
eries we see portrait works, square works and landscape works all with the =
same complexity and similar style of imagery. If we some how put 0311-32 in=
 year 2002 then we have to ask well what about its sister print 0311-35? An=
d what about all the other works in the series? <br clear=3D"none"><br clea=
r=3D"none">In terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase developmen=
t there is an obvious deliberate progression. The start of which seems to c=
oincide with his purchase of a Roland HiFi printer in early 2000 along with=
 a switch to Windows NT/2000 around the same time.&nbsp; The two works at S=
otheby's express the zenith in terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine=
 phase development. The next phase (2004+) is much different as we can see =
in only 2004 work we have at Sotheby's. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"non=

ned 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002. I don't know what the implications of th=
is are. I hope it is like the mint minting a coin and making a mistake impr=
essing the wrong year. And in turn by doing so created something rare and m=

 the physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file timestamp is 2003. But=
 this would certainly suggest an error. Did Tom write down the information =
