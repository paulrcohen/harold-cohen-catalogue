Hi Paul,

It=E2=80=99s no problem to burn the NFT and re-issue it as it has not =
been transferred or publicized yet.

Are you OK with this wording?

=E2=80=9CThe Harold Cohen Trust notes that the artist has signed this =
print as 2002 but has concluded this was an error.  The file name =
0311-32 refers to the year 2003, the month November and the 32nd Aaron =
generated work in that month.'

Thanks

Robert

Maybe in general an auction is not the proper venue for selling works =
that include signing errors. Maybe in those cases it would be better to =
have a one-on-one conversation with the collector on the reality and =
provide a more complete story of the work. And maybe this is what we =
should do regarding this work.

when you visited)... in there the work is documented as being 2003. So =
again everything points to the work being 2003 and that Harold made an =
error.
>>>>>=20

explanation, internally we will have implications as well. And these =
implications may actually out way the concern of the implications =

catalog in its current or expanded form more widely available, the =
catalog will not jive with the certificate. And in any other instance =
whereby Harold referred to this work (this includes multiple Powerpoint =
presentations, speeches and the like) the confusion is only exasperated =
due to that one number in pencil being written as a 2 and not a 3.

it might have been able to do so would have been very late summer of =
2003. Also, the work in question (0311-32) & its sister print at =
Sotheby's (0311-35) both belong to a series of works that were all =
generated in Oct 2003. And in this series we see portrait works, square =
works and landscape works all with the same complexity and similar style =

Yes, meaning the physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file =
timestamp is 2003. But this would certainly suggest an error. Did Tom =
write down the information incorrectly? Is that the error? No. The =
timestamp for the aa file is 2003 and the signed print is 2002.

But, we don't know why the generated work seems to be in the future. If =
the second scenario is true, how could it be true? Maybe, the version of =
AARON Harold used was from 2002 and that he simply ran it in 2003.

already fixed as potentials in the 2001.

        <div dir=3D"ltr"><div>Dear Robert,<br clear=3D"none">I looked =
into the matter and the short answer is still the same -- the digital =
files are timestamped 2003 and the print is signed 2002. I did not find =
any evidence to support the idea that the files were some how generated =
in 2002 instead of 2003. I came to this conclusion by examining the all =
the digital &amp; physical works from the beginning of 2002 to the end =
2003 in chronological order. Ideally I would lay out a visual timeline =
so we can see the progression of AARON's development over that time. =
That will take quite a bit of time to put together so I will leave that =
to a future date. But I did note in my notebook the style and key =
elements that each of the versions of AARON produced during the 2002-03 =
time period. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">By doing this, it =
became quite clear that AARON was not capable of producing anything in =
2002 even remotely close to the plant imagery of 0311-32 (i23-3405) in =
terms of variety and complexity. The earliest it might have been able to =
do so would have been very late summer of 2003. Also, the work in =
question (0311-32) &amp; its sister print at Sotheby's (0311-35) both =
belong to a series of works that were all generated in Oct 2003. And in =
this series we see portrait works, square works and landscape works all =
with the same complexity and similar style of imagery. If we some how =
put 0311-32 in year 2002 then we have to ask well what about its sister =
print 0311-35? And what about all the other works in the series? <br =
clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">In terms of AARON's =
early-post-painting-machine phase development there is an obvious =
deliberate progression. The start of which seems to coincide with his =
purchase of a Roland HiFi printer in early 2000 along with a switch to =
Windows NT/2000 around the same time.&nbsp; The two works at Sotheby's =
express the zenith in terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase =
development. The next phase (2004+) is much different as we can see in =
only 2004 work we have at Sotheby's. <br clear=3D"none"><br =
clear=3D"none">Of course Harold is not here to ask what happened. I =
rather think he signed 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002. I don't know what =
the implications of this are. I hope it is like the mint minting a coin =
and making a mistake impressing the wrong year. And in turn by doing so =
created something rare and more valuable as because by adding human =
error this work truly is "unique."<br clear=3D"none"><br =
