 Dear Robert,
I looked into the matter and the short answer is still the same -- the digi=
tal files are timestamped 2003 and the print is signed 2002. I did not find=
 any evidence to support the idea that the files were some how generated in=
 2002 instead of 2003. I came to this conclusion by examining the all the d=
igital & physical works from the beginning of 2002 to the end 2003 in chron=
ological order. Ideally I would lay out a visual timeline so we can see the=
 progression of AARON's development over that time. That will take quite a =
bit of time to put together so I will leave that to a future date. But I di=
d note in my notebook the style and key elements that each of the versions =
of AARON produced during the 2002-03 time period.=20

By doing this, it became quite clear that AARON was not capable of producin=
g anything in 2002 even remotely close to the plant imagery of 0311-32 (i23=
-3405) in terms of variety and complexity. The earliest it might have been =
able to do so would have been very late summer of 2003. Also, the work in q=
uestion (0311-32) & its sister print at Sotheby's (0311-35) both belong to =
a series of works that were all generated in Oct 2003. And in this series w=
e see portrait works, square works and landscape works all with the same co=
mplexity and similar style of imagery. If we some how put 0311-32 in year 2=
002 then we have to ask well what about its sister print 0311-35? And what =
about all the other works in the series?=20

In terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase development there is =
an obvious deliberate progression. The start of which seems to coincide wit=
h his purchase of a Roland HiFi printer in early 2000 along with a switch t=
o Windows NT/2000 around the same time.=C2=A0 The two works at Sotheby's ex=
press the zenith in terms of AARON's early-post-painting-machine phase deve=
lopment. The next phase (2004+) is much different as we can see in only 200=
4 work we have at Sotheby's.=20

Of course Harold is not here to ask what happened. I rather think he signed=
 0311-32 inadvertently as 2002. I don't know what the implications of this =
are. I hope it is like the mint minting a coin and making a mistake impress=
ing the wrong year. And in turn by doing so created something rare and more=
 valuable as because by adding human error this work truly is "unique."

Just to clarify Sotheby=E2=80=99s are not asking about the print as this sp=
readsheet specifically refers to the image file for the NFT. Is it possible=
 that the program was run in 2002 but the image not saved until 2003?
Perhaps your answer is the same for the image as it was for the print but j=

Hi Robert,When it comes to Harold there rarely is a quick answer. Since the=
 physical print date precedes the aa file timestamp by one year, that begs =
the question, "How is this possible?" I know you probably want a quick yes =
or no answer. If that is true then the quick is answer yes. Yes, meaning th=
e physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file timestamp is 2003. But th=
is would certainly suggest an error. Did Tom write down the information inc=
orrectly? Is that the error? No. The timestamp for the aa file is 2003 and =
the signed print is 2002.=20

It seems like we have one of two scenarios. One, Harold signed the physical=
 print incorrectly.=C2=A0 Two, he signed the print correctly. But, we don't=
 know why the generated work seems to be in the future. If the second scena=
rio is true, how could it be true? Maybe, the version of AARON Harold used =
was from 2002 and that he simply ran it in 2003.=20

We had a situation at the Whitney this past year whereby all the work was g=
enerated in 2023 and then plotted in 2024. However, the version of AARON ge=
nerating the work was from 2001. We may think these are 2024 works because =
they were plotted in 2024. But maybe in the mind of the artist they are rea=
lly 2001 works because all the works were already fixed as potentials in th=
e 2001.

I'm not sure if the second scenario can be confirmed or not as I never thou=
ght about this before. When I go to the studio Tuesday, I will see what I c=
an find. I also sent a message to Cohen's 2002-2003 assistant and waiting f=
or her thoughts and this matter.

Hi Tom

Sothebys have flagged this work as the production year says 2002 but the de=
scription of the file says the file was created in 2003.=C2=A0=20

Can you confirm this is correct?

Thanks

Hi Robert,</div><div style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><s=
pan style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">When it comes to Ha=
rold there rarely is a quick answer. Since the=20
physical print date precedes the aa file timestamp by one year, that begs t=
he=20
question, "How is this possible?"</span> I know you probably want a quick y=
es or no answer. If that is true then the quick is answer yes. Yes, meaning=
 the physical work is signed as 2002 and the aa file timestamp is 2003. But=
 this would certainly suggest an error. Did Tom write down the information =
incorrectly? Is that the error? No. The timestamp for the aa file is 2003 a=
nd the signed print is 2002. <br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=3D"ltr" styl=
e=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br clear=3D"none"></div><d=
iv dir=3D"ltr" style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">It seems=
 like we have one of two scenarios. One, Harold signed the physical print i=
ncorrectly.&nbsp; Two, he signed the print correctly. But, we don't know wh=
y the generated work seems to be in the future. If the second scenario is t=
rue, how could it be true? Maybe, the version of AARON Harold used was from=
 2002 and that he simply ran it in 2003. <br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=

uation at the Whitney this past year whereby all the work=20
was generated in 2023 and then plotted in 2024. However, the version of=20
AARON generating the work was from 2001. We may think these are 2024 works=
=20
because they were plotted in 2024. But maybe in the mind of the artist=20
they are really 2001 works because all the works were already fixed as=20
potentials in the 2001.</span><br clear=3D"none"></div><div dir=3D"ltr" sty=

 sure if the second scenario can be confirmed or not as I never thought abo=
ut this before. When I go to the studio Tuesday, I will see what I can find=
. I also sent a message to Cohen's 2002-2003 assistant and waiting for her =
