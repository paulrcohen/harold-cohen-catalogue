Hi Mr. Crowley, I received the email that you sent to the Harold Cohen
Trust about interviewing Harold for an NBC segment on the upcoming
Christies sale. I'm the Trustee and Harold Cohen's son.  Harold died in
2016, so you won't be able to interview him.  I might be able to answer
some of your questions or you might like to speak with Mila Askarova at the
Gazelli Art House in London, which represents the Trust, or with Christiane
Paul at the Whitney Museum of American Art.  Cristiane curated a major
exhibition of Harold's work at the Whitney last year.  I can't speak to
Mila's or Christiane's availability though. Thanks, --Paul
