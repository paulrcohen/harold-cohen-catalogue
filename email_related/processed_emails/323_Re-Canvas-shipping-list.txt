Hi Paul,

Great to hear from you.

Yes, we are all on the same page with regards to Mila's idea of pricing the
medium-sized works on canvas in relation to their 'quality'. The four works
I highlighted would be priced at £150,000, and the first 'batch' we can
sell.

Regarding the Art Fairs strategy, I think the best route forward is to
decide on the selection depending on which fairs we get into. Currently we
are in the process of applying for/waiting to be invited to, both Armory
NYC and Dallas. So we can make a selection once we get in? But either way,
are we agreed that the four paintings I highlighted are ok to be priced at
£150,000?

Regarding Tom Gruber, we are getting a good deal if we buy his work, but it
is a purchase decision, so I will leave it up to you both.

The Artsy alert is in relation to a group show we have curated over the
Christmas and New Year period called 'Quiet Motion'. We have priced the 60s
work at £100,000. The pricing is aligned with the 60s canvases we showed
during 'Refactoring'.

Let me know if that's all clear? We're really excited to see what Tom will
send over in the roll!

With warmest wishes,

George Barke
