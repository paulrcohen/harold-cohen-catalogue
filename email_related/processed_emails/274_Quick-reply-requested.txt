Hi Tom, first I must apologize for asking for a quick answer: Can you have a look at this opportunity <https://schmidtsciences.smapply.io/prog/humanities_and_artificial_intelligence_virtual_institute_havi_/> from the Schmidt Sciences and let me know whether you’d like to participate in something I’ve been calling the 21st Century Catalogue Raisonne. Basically the idea is to use all we know about an artist — the art, writing, exhibitions, email, lectures, correspondence, photos etc. — to build a really thorough, organized, conversational catalogue raisonne. I’ve started work on such a thing for Harold based on some earlier work on machine reading, machine learning, knowledge curation and other stuff. Anthropic say they’re interested. We have until next week to get a 3-pager done. If they like it then we have a couple of months to write a proper proposal. 

Can you let me know if you are interested and whether I can add you as a participant, please. Many thanks, —P
