Dear Mima,

Thanks you so much! I downloaded the videos of Haroldâ€™s talk and they play fine. I will be reviewing the whole video soon. It is okay if you cannot access your old emails. But if you still have the interview between you and Harold from the year 2000, and it is not too much trouble, I would appreciate being able to listen to it.
