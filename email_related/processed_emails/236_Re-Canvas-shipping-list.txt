Hi George, sorry for my delayed reply. My recollection of the pricing
discussion is similar to yours, but not quite the same, and my recollection
of our strategy might be a bit different as well.

I recall that the pricing discussion changed from "size-based" to
"quality-based". Mila pointed out that some mid-sized works are better
than others. She asked why some should not be priced at X, where X is
higher than 150K. FWIW, I think the four mid-sized works cited in your
email aren't the best, so I won't argue that their price should be higher.
But if we were planning to show, say, 2475 or 2476 etc. then I'd agree with
Mila: These are better paintings.

As to strategy, we discussed several but I don't remember which we settled
on. At one point in the conversation, Mila suggested not sending large
works to the art fairs but holding them back. At another point we
discussed sending a mix of mid-size and large work. I think we all agreed
that small canvases are anomalous and will be held back. You seem to be
suggesting sending a mix of mid-sized and large works priced at 150K and
300K, respectively. Do you intend that the mid-sized works for the fairs
will be the ones you mention in your message, or were you suggesting only
that these works should be priced at 150K as our first tranche irrespective
of where they are shown for sale?

Changing subject, any further thoughts on us purchasing Tom Gruber's
paintings?

Incidentally, I got an alert from Artsy this morning. Is this just a
random spasmodic mailing or have we started to market the early work?
