Hi Bre,

Hope you are well.  Hoping to get some preliminary background on the possibility of an idea Paul mentioned.  How close to a mural-size work do you think your plotters could plot? Is 48 or 60 inch wide paper a possibility? Is even larger, say 8 or 10 ft possible? And instead having a person manually mount each sheet like at the Whitney, is it possible to have a roll of paper? Like, say a 60” x 100 foot roll or 48” x 350 ft? Or multiple rolls? And plot maybe a 60x48inch area at a time. And then advance the roll for the next plot? Or could it somehow plot an area, whatever size that maybe, and then, move to another area and plot that other area. And move about across whatever space is available to complete the work? And maybe more importantly than the size… could all of this be done vertically? This may be a bit ambitious, but in a sense, I am asking how close do you think you could get to making a vertical turtle that would execute multiple murals and do so with minimal human intervention. And however close that might be, what would that look like?
