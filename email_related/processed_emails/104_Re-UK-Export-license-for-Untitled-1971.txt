Dear GeorgeThanks for the information. I do plan to be out of town a few days +/- Jan 7th but I think the general time frame of early next year is doable. 

Regarding additional works, there are no additional canvas paintings that fit the 6 parameters.Â 
As for a pickup. I am currently reorganizing the remaining 15 drawers of works yet to be inventoried so that they are grouped into logical groups and not just strewn wherever. Once the work to be shipped is pulled, ideally it is picked up in a timely manner. It would be helpful to know if the shipper will need the studio space for preparing the work to be shipped. That would help me determine how much other work I can have out in order to continue the grouping process.

A few of the drawers do not have artwork but rather other artifacts. One in particular has posters from some of Harold's 1983 exhibitions. Might we send a few of these at this time? We multiple duplicates of these posters all in excellent condition:Brooklyn Museum 
Tate
Arnolfini 
National Museum of Wales 

Also, I know this is not part of the works that fit the 6 parameters, but we have a group of large sized wood framed prints behind plexi-glass that have to sit on the studio floor as we don't have a proper place to store them and they are slowly getting damaged. Some are from the same time period as they ones auctioned off this past fall. Others are more recent like 2010 or so. One of them is a signed Machine Painting. I am assuming the Machine Painting will go. I am wondering if some or all of the others should go at this time. There are 8 of them. All of them are signed works.
