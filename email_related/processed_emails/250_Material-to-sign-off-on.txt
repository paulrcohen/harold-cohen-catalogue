Hi,

Sharing with you the material for final sign off!
(Please note this is being reviewed by Sotheby's too so there might be some
tweaks made to it)

Their main concern was the uniqueness of the work. It has to be identified
as unique, despite the physical print saying otherwise. The way around
this, we suggest the wording that is found both in the press release (at
the bottom) and the description of the NFT: "Unique, signed edition and the
only known one that has been produced during the artist's lifetime."
Are you happy with this?

My best,
