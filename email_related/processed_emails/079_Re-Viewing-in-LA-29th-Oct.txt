Tom, thanks very much for this careful analysis. I’m so glad you did it
and I’m sure you will continue to be careful about the consequences of
selling particular work. As I understand your email, selling ag4 would
“break” the portfolio but I’m not sure what that means. Does it mean the
folio would no longer have at least two of each work? We haven’t
considered what it means for a folio to be “intact” so I am very glad you
brought this up.

Are any AG works available in the sense that we have more than two of them?
If we are defining the master folio as “two of each” then selling a third
wouldn’t break the folio.
