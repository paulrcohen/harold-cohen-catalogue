Dear Thomas

I have looked at the cataloguing for “Tomorrow’s World” on 22 March 2000, and it does include an item with the following details:

ITEM 06: TURING TEST: TW's 3rd Turing Test: Can people identify paintings by computers from paintings by humans?

I have viewed the item, it mentions Harold Cohen but gives very little other information – it shows a computer artwork with the result of a test (as in the item title) to see how many people in a sample could tell which of three options was generated by machine. This edition of “Tomorrow’s World” was billed as “Live Lab” and was a special programme for National Science Week, including a number of live experiments and tests.

“Tomorrow’s World” was a long-running popular science magazine programme, usually covering new inventions and techniques.

Kind regards

Andrew

Dear Andrew,

Previously you helped me with requests regarding British artist Harold Cohen (1928-2016). I hope you can help with my latest request. We have an internal document claiming that the BBC aired a show titled “Tomorrow’s World” on or around March 22, 2000. Our understanding is that Harold Cohen’s AARON was included in this program. Do you have any evidence in your archives of this? If so can you share any details of what may have been included in the program or why Harold Cohen’s AARON was included?
