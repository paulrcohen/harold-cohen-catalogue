Dear Andrew,
Previously you helped me with requests regarding British artist Harold Cohen (1928-2016). I hope you can help with my latest request. We have an internal document claiming that the BBC aired a show titled “Tomorrow’s World” on or around March 22, 2000. Our understanding is that Harold Cohen’s AARON was included in this program. Do you have any evidence in your archives of this? If so can you share any details of what may have been included in the program or why Harold Cohen’s AARON was included?
