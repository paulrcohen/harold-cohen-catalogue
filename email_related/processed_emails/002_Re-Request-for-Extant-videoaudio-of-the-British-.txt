Dear Andrew,Much thanks for looking into our requests and for the quick response. Sorry for my delayed response as I was following up on another lead regarding the Director of Sunday Night: Five for Venice. 

I understand the "Sunday Night: Five for Venice" is no longer extant in your archives. I have since found some additional information which confirms what you wrote but also hope that maybe a copy still is extant. I understand the late Ann Turner (1927-2018) was the film director of the programme. In a voice recorded interviewed by Alan Lawson in 1995 she provides the details on the films demise where she says*(see note below), "BBC One, I had a five for Venice on the 25th of October in 1966. I'd spent a year following around the British Council something we could never do these days. Actually, with the five artists concern, which are known as Tony Cairo, Danny Cairo, Robin Denny now CBE, the two Cohen's Harold and Bernard and Dick Smith and Lillian Somerville, Sir Herbert Read. David Thompson was involved as the catalogue was his. And I think it's a very interesting film. And I would very much like to see it except BBC lent it to Nancy for ?OU? thing. Humphrey had not signed the retention order. And the thing was junked with its negative when it came back to film library, Alan Hanson nearly went through the roof, because you know all those artists are important. And they were all in their studios talking about their work."
That is a pity. But Ann Turner goes on to say later in the interview,"One of the things I have not followed up is if whether the British Council, I may simply have given them a copy with luck, they might have kept it you know."Â  Do you have any thoughts on how I would approach the British Council to ask if they have a copy? 

Also regarding the other finds. This is wonderful news. What do we need to do to get a listing of sorts from you?
