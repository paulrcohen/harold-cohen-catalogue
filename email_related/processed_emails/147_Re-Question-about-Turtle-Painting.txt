Hi Tom,

Many thanks for getting back to me.

Apologies for any confusion. My question was: do you know if there are any
of the large 'Turtle' paintings, aside from the Tate, in public/museum
collections? I was wondering if any of the museum shows where he produced
those works (image attached, SFMoMA 1979, for example) had kept them in
their permanent collection. But if, as you say 'there are “no" known works
that exist– at all – that were composed and executed at any of these
shows'. Then that's the answer. I'm curious what happened to them, but I
guess they were destroyed and not acquired by the Museums at the time?

Thanks for sending over such a detailed document of the work in the Tate
collection too. I really appreciate the in-depth research.

Thanks again,

George
