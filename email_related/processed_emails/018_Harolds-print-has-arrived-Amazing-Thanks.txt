hi Paul and Tom, 

Thank you for the Harold Cohen print. Its perfect. The image fits right in to what Harold was doing when I was in the lab, and then the printing itself is very elegant. So greatly appreciated. 

Please give me some info: 

1. What year was the image made? 

2. When was it printed?

3. How, and on what paper? 

4. What is the yellow sticker mean i23-0577? should I remove if, if so, will it damage the print? 

Thank you, 

PS. I hope the codes you got are useful. They dont show how harold designed the drawing process but they show the interface between the PDP 11 and the Tektronix 4014. I will continue to search in the boxes. The location of this code was not apparent when Tom you came by as it was part of my tenure application at USC.
