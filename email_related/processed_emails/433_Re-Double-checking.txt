Becky replied this morning that it is her photo. This means that the Tate
needs her permission to use it. I don’t know whether they need permission
to use the other photos. The one that appears in thevTelegraph might also
be hers. All I can suggest is that the Tate should email becky asap, as I
can’t give them permission to use one of her photos. Her email is
beckycohenphotographer@gmail.com. -p
