Thanks Paul for your input and good to have an agreed direction.

With your agreement, we will change the year if production from 2002 to 2003 and add a note to the COA for the print with the following text:

“The Harold Cohen Trust notes that the artist has signed this print as 2002 but has concluded this was an error. The file name 0311-32 refers to the year 2003, the month November and the 32nd Aaron generated work in that month.'

We will also need to burn the existing NFT and re-mint it with the correct date. Please let me know if this works and I’ll inform Sotheby’s.

Best

Robert

Far from raising questions about the dates of the other prints, the research that went into resolving this anomaly should convince Sotheby's and collectors that we are very serious about the dates.
