Hi Tom,
So nice to hear from you and likewise, I hope you're doing well! Thanks for sharing your amazing research, I really appreciate your attention to detail.

We didn't photograph the KCAT images we selected for our archives but maybe we could retrieve them from storage and look through them in a Zoom meeting with you? Or could you tell us what exactly you're looking for, so that David could go through the drawings and take photos of ones that might be of interest?
Let me know what might work best for you.
Thanks so much,
Christiane
