 Hi Tom, I think it’s great!  Please give Nina my best wishes. Thanks! P


Hi Paul
I have been in contact with Harold’s former assistant Nina Karavasiles. Her time with Harold was approximately 1989 to 1995. She has been helpful in filling in details from the transition from drawing to painting time period. Would it be ok for her to visit the studio next week. I would like to ask her some further questions regarding the works that will be sent to London before they go. Let me know if you think that would be ok for her to visit the studio,
Tom
