 Hi Thomas,
Dietl are arranging.They have said that their local collecting agent is a little busy, so it may be a moment before they get in touch to schedule the visit / pickup.I'll follow up with them and see if they have any availability.

Hi Michael,I have not heard from the shipper yet. If they called and I was unable to take it, they did not leave a message. I was assuming they would initiate the call. Maybe that was incorrect. In any case, there is no action yet toward the net step. Please advise.
