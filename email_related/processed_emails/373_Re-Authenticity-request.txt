Hi Mila, I don't think we should authenticate work without a lawyer
standing by, but that said, the image that looks vaguely like a tree,
initialed HC, is not like anything I've seen from Harold. But that doesn't
mean much. Given the signature and the date it could be Harold's rough
idea of what he was aiming for, but then I'd expect it to be in a notebook
and none of the notebooks I've seen has anything like it.

Whereas the two images called painting two and painting two almost
certainly are Harold's. We have the notebooks where he designed the
numbers. These works are in shockingly bad shape!
