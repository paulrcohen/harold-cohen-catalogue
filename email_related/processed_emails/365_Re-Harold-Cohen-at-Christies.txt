Likewise, thanks so much for the introduction, Paul!
I'd also be happy to answer any questions (you find information about the Whitney Museum exhibition here<https://whitney.org/exhibitions/harold-cohen-aaron>).

Harold Cohen: AARON | Whitney Museum of American Art<https://whitney.org/exhibitions/harold-cohen-aaron>
This exhibition traces the evolution of Harold Cohens AARON, the earliest artificial intelligence (AI) program for artmaking. Leaving behind his practice as an established painter in London, Cohen (19282016) conceived the software in the late 1960s at the University of California, San Diego, and named it AARON in the early 1970s.
