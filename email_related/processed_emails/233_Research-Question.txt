Hi Christiane, 
Happy Thursday and happy June already! I hope you can help me with a question. From time to time I work on researching where Cohen’s works are. Harold left behind lists of museums and other entities but did not necessarily document what those works were. Also in the case of Robert Hendel and others who may have had the original an original work they then donate to a museum. Unless they notify us we are not aware of the transfer. Therefore, the list doesn’t necessarily help. 
I can (and do from time to time) contact various institutions. Some institutions have the ability to search on the website others do not. Are you aware of some sort of database for museums and/or other institutions that may have what I am looking for — name lists of Cohen works? Also, when I do contact a museum, when I don’t have a personal contact, I rarely make any headway. Do you have any suggestions on what department or what position I ask for? Or any other suggestions? I’d appreciate you thoughts.
Hope all is well,
Tom
