Hi George,I have an additional comment. Although, it is more like a question mark. Below are two photos. The first one (0394A RA26) with the tire swing shape behind Harold is the one now at the Tate. The second one (Slide-0394b no RA) is unidentified.  As my research focus for Valentina Ravaglia was to clarify the title of the work, I did not research more deeply about the unidentified one. I would like to think the unidentified one was the one Harold asked me to destroy sometime ago. If not, then this a question mark.

George,

The works at Documenta ’77 were ink on paper drawn by the Turtle. According to notes/correspondences from Harold, he claims they were given to schools. I have found no evidence of the potential names of the schools. Basically the same answer for the Stedlijk show also 1977. These too were works on paper given to schools yet to be located. 

As for the full color paintings that are not murals, there are 3:

 - 
RA26 now with Tate previously shown at they 1979 Reno Nevada show and also known as Reno 2 or AARON Drawing #1

 - 
RA40 sent to Gazelli also shown previously at Reno and known as Reno 1

 - 
RA46 now with Thoma not known to have been shown at a show prior to the Thoma acquisition – was shown on TV while in process of being painted

As for the 1979 SFMOMA show, two things were going on. One, the Turtle was making drawings on paper just like Stedlijk and Documenta. Two, the mural behind him was executed onsite. I don’t yet know what happened to the mural. We might have the mural panels in the studio or we might not. I did open one of the folded panels a few years ago. That panel looked like a panel from the early 1980s – possibly the one shown at the Tate in the early 1980s. It was certainly not 1979. I could try opening up other panels but it may need to wait as the only space to accommodate the size of these panels is the living room and the family has visitors this week. That is, unless, I can figure something else out. I hope we have it as that would explain what happened to the SFMOMA mural. I know this maybe a whole ‘nother’ can of worms but there are other pre-1980 murals. They may not necessarily be paintings on canvas but they may exist in public space. This is on our list to do but not much has been down towards that yet.

 Hi Tom, 
Many thanks for getting back to me. 
Apologies for any confusion. My question was: do you know if there are any of the large 'Turtle' paintings, aside from the Tate, in public/museum collections? I was wondering if any of the museum shows where he produced those works (image attached, SFMoMA 1979, for example) had kept them in their permanent collection. But if, as you say 'there are “no" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows'. Then that's the answer. I'm curious what happened to them, but I guess they were destroyed and not acquired by the Museums at the time? 
Thanks for sending over such a detailed document of the work in the Tate collection too. I really appreciate the in-depth research. 
Thanks again, 
George

Hi George,

I am not sure I understand the question correctly. So, just to be clear, of the three shows you mention, there are “no" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows. 

If we are referring to canvas works, there were 3 executed after these shows. One is now at the Tate. One is with Thoma. And we sent you the 3rd one. We have a 4th canvas work that is black lines only in the studio – no coloring. I did a detailed investigation for Valentina Ravaglia of the Tate into their work (RA26) for their Electric Dreams which you can view here if interested. 

RA26 (Oct 1979) - A Deeper Look

Shortly after I began working for Harold, he had me destroy a canvas work which may have been from that same period. But I really don’t know. It might have been more recent. 

We have a tiny collection of early non-canvas works. These are folded cloth works. Some are multi-panel-mural works, others a single panel. I hope to get to document them this year. The time period range of these works is not known but I rather think they are late 1970s early 1980s. 

If there are additional works out there, I am not aware of them. When I looked into the details and origins of the Tate’s RA26, I did not come across any information suggesting more than the known 4 canvas works were executed in the 1977-1979 style of AARON. 

Hope that helps, if you need anything else let me know,

Tom

 Hi Tom and Paul, 
I hope you are both doing well? 
Aside from the Tate, do you know how many of the large Turtle paintings are in museum or public collections? Shows at that time include Documenta 6, group show (1977), Stedejilk, solo show (1977) and SFMoMA, solo (1979). 
Really appreciate your help, as always! 
George
