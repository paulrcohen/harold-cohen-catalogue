Hi both,

We have been approached by two separate people looking to
authenticate/certify these works.
We do not have anything more than just these images to go by.
Although we do know that two of them came from an estate sale from a few
weeks ago (in SF Bay Area).

I don't know if the images only are enough to have them authenticated, but
we suggest getting back to them with the following:
We can only authenticate works that come to us directly from the HCT.

Going forward, what do you think should be our process here?
We can certainly tackle this once the catalogue raisonne is under way -
this is both on the backend, having each work blockchain certified and
having a clear idea of the existence of each work, even if not physically
located at the studio.

Speak soon,
Mila
