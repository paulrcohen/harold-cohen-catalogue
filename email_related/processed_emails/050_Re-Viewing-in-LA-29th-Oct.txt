Hi Mila,Unfortunately, we do not have a signed edition #4 at all. We are missing that one. We only have 2 unsigned #4 works. I rather think the probability of finding any additional IAG prints is low, however, not zero. There is a drawer with smaller works that have yet to be organized properly. So if we do have any it would most likely be there. We do have 2 complete sets of editions #1-12 that are unsigned.

 Hi both,
Many thanks for all this.I've put the IAG works and all the info we currently have on the prints in the second tab of our 'master spreadsheet'. Please disregard our inventory numbers for now (some are duplicated for internal purposes) and the internal notes in the Note column. The rest should be accurate.

Paul, I agree we should identify a reference folio that will not be for sale.
Tom, can you confirm you have the complete set of edition 2/10 for the whole folio (1-12) framed or unframed, and 3/10? Is it possible that other edition numbers will come up from this folio, or highly unlikely?
So far we have sold: #4 edition ; #6 edition and #9 edition all numbers 1/10 We have paused any offerings from the series for now till we decide on the best way forward.
So for the non-reference folio, available to sell, we could hold back on say edition 2/10 for each of the images in this folio (1-12) and/or 3/10 (if that is a full series too), and are able to sell the rest?
My best,Mila



Folks, here's a thought about strategy for folios.  Please let me know what you think:

Define a folio to be a collection of prints that have some coherence (e.g., AG1 - AG12)
Define a reference folio to be a folio that can be used as reference material for reprinting or by scholars etc.  Note that a reference folio can contain damaged works provided the damage does not prevent the reference material being used as intended.  Note also that a reference folio need not be signed. 

As with individual works, we should never sell the reference folio.
That's the easy part. Now the harder part concerns selling work from nonreference folios.  Here we need guidance from Mila.  I think we could make the argument that we should not break up the last of a folio, unless the prices warrant it or there is no prospect of selling the entire folio as a unit. Suppose we have two copies of a folio (e.g., two undamaged copies of each of the 12 prints in AG), then I would argue that we can sell from one of these folios. 

What do you think?
