Hi Joel thanks for getting in touch! It was good to see you last night.
As to your projects, please call in us if we can help. Let me introduce you
to Tom Machnik, who worked with Harold for many years and currently is the
Trust studio manager and informal historian. Tom has vast deep knowledge
about Harold and his work, so Iâ€™m sure you and he will have much to
discuss. Keep me in the loop if it helps. Looking forward. P
