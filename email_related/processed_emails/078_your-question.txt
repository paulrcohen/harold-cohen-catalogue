Dear Anastasia,Sorry I didn’t see your message earlier on slack as I didn’t get a notification for some reason until Paul replied.
In any case, I am not sure I understand your question exactly. Here is a link to my notes indicating what we had in house prior to the shipment to you.

I believe you are interested in the bottom one which in my notes is referred to as Version 6 / 77D6. According to my notes we had at one time 3 unsigned B/W works, 2 signed B/W works and 2 hand colored works for a total of 7.  
If you are asking how many were made in total during Harold’s lifetime, I don’t have an answer for that. I have not yet come across any details describing on how many lithographs were ordered. 
If I didn’t answer your question, let me know. I’d be happy help you further,Tom
