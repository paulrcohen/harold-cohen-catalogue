Dear Eva,

Nice to meet you virtually. I appreciate you taking a moment to read my 
request. My name is Tom Machnik. I am the Art Studio Manager for the 
Harold Cohen Trust. Susan Grabowski reached out to us about a year or so 
ago regarding a project she is spearheading and we joyfully contributed 
to her project. She connected me to you because I asked about the 
following related to research I am doing that involves HNF and the 
people there.

I am currently piecing together Cohen/AARON works and history during his 
transitional period from his Painting Machine Era to his use of 
Commercial wide format printers (approximately from 1998 to 2002). We 
have limited archival documents from that time, but we do have a 
correspondence whereby Cohen discusses with Andreas Schulze an upcoming 
show at HNF. Based on HNF's website there does seem to have been a show 
there in Feb 2002. Our communications suggest some event may have also 
occurred at HNF in Fall of 2001. Based on our documents HNF may have 
been involved in the actual production of these works. As these HNF 
shows/events may have been the first international public showing from 
Cohen/AARON after his Painting Machine Era, they are of much interest to 
the Trust. Since we seem to be missing details regarding this show, I am 
seeking to connect with Andreas Schulze or anyone who may have been 
involved with Cohen either directly or indirectly. If you can connect me 
with anyone, that would be wonderful.

Much appreciation for your time. I wish you well.
