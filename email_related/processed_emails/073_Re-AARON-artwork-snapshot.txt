Hi Tom, I’m not familiar with the picture but there were a lot of them and I might have seen it but forgotten it. The resolution is low so I can’t make out the weaving together of color groups, though I can see that it’s happening, which make me think it is probably authentic. I’m a bit surprised at the bright rim of the pot; I don’t recall Harold doing that. Who is the email from? —P

I am assuming the SANY of the filename indicates it was from a Sanyo digital camera. Does this happen to look familiar to you? Or have any thoughts regarding this work? Tom
