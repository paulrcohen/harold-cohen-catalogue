Oops sorry I was replying to Mila's before seeing this. All 9 are all signed and they are all signed as YYMM## 1 / x Harold Cohen year. 
With regards to works floating around there are other works floating around 2 of x and 3 of x etc as we have evidence of these works being shown. We also have extra prints unsigned in the studio. They maybe of a different size. There is one print signed as an AP. 
The key to me is the NFT + Print combo we can only sell one signed work of this as a combo because we have no other signed works.
