Hi George,Good to hear from you. Sorry about the delay. Yesterday, I was at a good friend of Harold’s yesterday doing inventory of their collection of Cohen/AARON works which turns out the collection spans the time period from 1971 to 2012. The 1971 work is one of the original LACMA Maze drawings that were executed and mail out as invitations to the 1972 show. Another important discovery is that they have one of the panels from an important piece titled “The Age of Intelligent Machines (1986).” We have two of the panels in the studio but I have long wondered why one was missing. Now I know where that is! 
In any case, you are interested in more recent works. The only information I have of 1991-1999 works being in collections is for Robert Hendel and Frank Dictrich. You are right "Stephanie and Friend” is with Whitney now but originally was with Robert Hendel’s collection. In addition to Stephanie and Friend, Hendel has or had multiple works from this time period. My understanding is that he was ok with the Whitney taking the other Cohen/AARON works in his collection but the Whitney does not accept entire private collections or something to that effect. So it is possible that additional works from this time period in his collection were sent to other museums.  Dictrich seems to have had only one work a 1997 piece and I don’t have any info on who he is yet. I don’t see any museums listed. I will look some more today but want to get this to you sooner than later,
I understand, your last official day is tomorrow. Feel free to keep in touch beyond that time. I wish you much luck in your future and look forward to the time with our paths will cross again.
Tom

 Hey Tom, 
I've been looking back on your fantastic research, and there is so much useful information there - specifically about the murals and the painting machine series. Thank you so much! The resources are invaluable. 
I've got what will hopefully be a quick question. Do you know which museums have AARON/Cohen's figurative works on canvas in their collection? Similar series and period as this one in the Whitney collection (Stephanie and Friends) https://whitney.org/collection/works/67981 
I don't think there are many, but please let me know? 
Looking forward to hearing from you, 
George Barker
