Tom,

Thanks for your time earlier. Per discussion we will go with:

1) the Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery
2) Use Harold Cohen Trust instead of HCT
3) We will use the file sizes as per the files themselves and not the file size in the Word Document you previously provided.
￼

Thanks for clarifying - we will pass this on to Sotheby’s.

Best

Robert
