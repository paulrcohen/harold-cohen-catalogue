Hi Tim,

We generated thousands of drawings and converted them to gcode for the
show. The are like 20gigs of drawings. The gcode isn’t easy to peruse, but
if you organize them from big to small then you can find all the plants
because they are much bigger files. When you visit, I can give you a usb
stick with all of them.

I’ve been running KCAT in my office for about a year and a half now on a
windows xp machine and if you take a pic of the drawing I can tell you if
I’ve seen anything like that.

In other news, I’ve got a magazine about Machine Arts coming out in about a
month and it has an article about the Harold Cohen Aaron show. Send me your
address and I’ll send you some for you and the trust. Also finally getting
around to having an editor look at the footage we shot of the show and
interviews we did with Christiane and Paul and you are missing from it,
once we start to see a story and start to pull a storyline together, I
reach out and we can record something on zoom.
