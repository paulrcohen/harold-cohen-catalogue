Robert, Mila, I spoke with Tom and he's preparing one document for each of
the nine works. Each document will contain provenance for the jpeg and the
metadata for the jpeg.

Just so you know, the provenance will say (for most of the works) that
Aaron generated a vector file in a custom format designed by Harold called
the "AA" format. Tom will say when each AA file was created. Then the AA
files were transformed to JPEGs. This happened later, mostly in 2005. Tom
will say when it happened for each work. However, for one work, Harold's
JPEG was corrupted. Tom found a postscript file for that work and created a
JPEG for it in 2024. The JPEG has the same parameters (reflected in the
metadata) as the originals. The provenance will identify Tom as Harold's
Studio Manager.

Tom says he can get this done within a few hours.
