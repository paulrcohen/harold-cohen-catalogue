Hey Tom and Paul,

I had artist Paul Rickards
https://shop.paulrickards.com/galleries/
do an artist residency at Bantam Tools and he fell in love with KCAT. He is
a vintage computing nerd and in a day he reverse engineered KCAT.

I donâ€™t know what projects you have but if you ever need an
artist/researcher/helper, he is your guy. He is a very sweet person who is
also brilliant.

While he was here he visited our local arts recycling center and found a
box of clothes patters from the 1970s and the poses of the models drawn on
these are the exact poses that the people in KCAT use!

Happy to do an intro if you like!

Bre
