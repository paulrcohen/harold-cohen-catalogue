Hi Paul,

I agree and have had lengthy conversations with Michael yesterday regarding
this as in all of our material we have always said that it was an editioned
work (as I mentioned before, even with the original selection we made had a
mix of editioned and 'unique' works to be printed - which was not flagged).
He apologised for missing this but did say that having other prints
(physical) with or without the NFT component to it, "floating around" on
the market is a "no-go".

From what I understand, all printed additional works of the selection that
was made for Sotheby's are not signed and vary in size. We could therefore
assume that these were 'reference prints' as Tom mentioned in some of his
findings and the intention of Harold's was always to publish the full
edition, but it never happened (as far as these 9 works go).

For future sales of any of these 9 works, if the need arises, we could
argue that the work will not be considered as part of this edition as it
will be reprinted posthumously and signed off by HCT. Thus, although the
image is the same, the work that will be on offer at Sotheby's is still
argued to be unique.

What do you think?
Happy to chat through over a call if easier.

Speak soon,
Mila
