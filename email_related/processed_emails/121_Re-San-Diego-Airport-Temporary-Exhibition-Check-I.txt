Hi Thomas,

We are pretty open to finding the best work we are able to feature, and then supporting the process to display it. I'm not sure entirely what you mean by "hang-ready," but I do believe we could support some fabrication or purchasing of mounts, etc. if needed. It would be ideal to understand the artwork you are thinking about.

The case does not have any particular restrictions. I will note, hanging from the ceiling of the case is difficult for anything that is of significant weight.

To my knowledge we have never displayed a screen behind the glass. The glass does have some reflection due to the number of windows in the space. That would be something we would want to consider if we did want to mount a digital display in the case. All our monitors have speakers built into them. I have not listened to the sound levels from behind glassbut my instinct is, we may want to lean toward using captions. There is presently overhead music in the space, which, I could look into having turned off, but I don't think it could be turned off for the entire year.

Thanks,
Daniel

Dear Daniel,
Thank-you for the dimensions, the photos and additional details. Yes, it they are helpful. With respect to hanging work, please let me know if this is correct, I am assuming our artwork must be hang-ready and that you provide whatever is necessary from your end to hang the hang-ready works. And if this is the case are there some kind of restrictions I should be aware of besides depth considerations and the reduced height due to lighting? One last question, have you ever had a screen display mounted in one of the glass cases? If so, is audio permitted?

Tom



Hi Tom,

Happy to share some specs for the two glass case areas we discussed.

I am attaching a document that outlines the dimensions for the single case at Checkpoint 6, and the four cases at Gate 51. Please only use these dimensions.

Checkpoint 6
Please note that we added power outlets (2 plugs each) on the left and right sides of this case. There are LED track lighting that reduces the usable top and bottom margins of the cases by about 8". These are moveable track light. They are not technically adjustable. They have some give, but are essentially up/down light.

Gate 51
We just added outlets to these cases as well. There is one single plug in the two small cases. There are two single plugs on either side of the larger cases. The lighting is fixed downlight only. It can be turned off separately from the electricity in the case.

Contracting
If we were able to work together to determine items that are available for loan and create a final display plan together, we believe it is likely we could enter into a sole-source agreement with you so you didn't need to go through the standard adjudication process. However, I believe we would need to get a real head start on that in the next month or so, in terms of what is possible.

Is this enough information? Is there anything further I can provide, or would you be open to a studio visit to continue the conversation, if that is easier?

Thanks,
Daniel

Dear Daniel,
Good to hear from you. Happy Monday!

Unfortunately, we have not had a chance to do a complete review of things as of yet as we have some pressing matters. However, it would be helpful at this time if you could provide the interior dimensions of the glass cases for our review process. We are particularly interested in depth measurement. In addition, it would be helpful if you can verify that all of the glass cases have a power outlet.

Also when you say, "We think we have an option that would allow us to directly contract with you to loan us some materials. Are you saying we would not need to submit a formal project plan for review?
