Many thanks Tom!

Just to also reiterate what we discussed with Paul when he was in London -
it would be easier for us to carry out the appropriate condition checks on
all these works, and inventorise them when we receive them at the gallery
so the works that are slightly damaged and/or in need of tlc, we’ll sort it
out.

Looking forward to receiving these and thanks so much for all your help.

My best,
Mila
