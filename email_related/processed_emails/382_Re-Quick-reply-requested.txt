Thanks, Tom. I don’t need anything right now and I’ll send you the proposal tomorrow. —P

Basically the idea is to use all we know about an artist — the art, writing, exhibitions, email, lectures, correspondence, photos etc. — to build a really thorough, organized, conversational catalogue raisonne. I’ve started work on such a thing for Harold based on some earlier work on machine reading, machine learning, knowledge curation and other stuff. Anthropic say they’re interested. We have until next week to get a 3-pager done. If they like it then we have a couple of months to write a proper proposal.
