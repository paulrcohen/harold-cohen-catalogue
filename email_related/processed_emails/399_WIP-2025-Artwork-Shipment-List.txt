Dear Gazelli Team,Below is a link to the 2025 Artwork Shipment List. This list is a work in progress and not complete. I ran into a problem with some of the portrait paintings dates. I am not sure why but some of them have the wrong dates so I am reviewing all of them. I did notice some other inconsistancies in the artlogic document compared to the original notes sometime ago but have not done a comprehensive review as of yet. In any case, I am plugging away at creating the list you can see most of it here. I need to move some items around to access some additional works which may be approximately 4 more items. Currently there are 54 items to be shipped. That is quite of few and I want to make sure everything it correct so I appreciate your patience as it will take a bit longer to complete. I do have most of the measurements that were not in the original artlogic doc George sent and hope to have all the measurements by Thursday or at least an estimated measurement as I suspect the measurements are important to the shipper.Â
