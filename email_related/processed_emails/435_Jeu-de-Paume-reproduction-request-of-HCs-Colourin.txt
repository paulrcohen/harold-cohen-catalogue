Hi Tom,

Hope all is well!
Excellent time we have spent with Paul this week and very productive.
George is due to write a note to you shortly too.

A quick request from the Spalters -

A museum in France, Jeu de Paume <https://jeudepaume.org/en/about-us/>, is
asking for the reproduction of some pages from Harold Cohen's drawing book
to include in their forthcoming publication as illustrations for a "time
capsule" entitled "Generative art", that draws connections between the
current developments of AI and earlier artistic endeavours.

If you agree, we would need to send HD files for print along with complete
captions , credits and copyrights to mention to them.

Let us know?

My best,
Mila
