Hi Paul,

Thanks for your time today. Please see below the proposed new wording. The Estate will be sending through further digital information today. However please check the proposed NFT description which we have also mocked up as to how it will appear on Opensea for ease of reference. 

We have also included the following:

Draft certificate from the Trust for the physical print
Draft Opensea Listing for the NFT with updated collection, wallet name, traits and description
Draft spreadsheet of NFTs with descriptions and dimensions
Draft spreadsheet of prints with descriptions and dimensions 
Draft Copy that needs your sign off as will be used by Sotheby’s in their outreach 

Please note we will need to provide you with the Verisart URLs for all the printed works as these will be certified separately from the NFTs and linked to from the NFT descriptions.

Please let us know if you require any changes as we would like to send across final copy for Sotheby’s by end of day your time. We will update NFT descriptions with any information we get from Tom in due course.

Best

Robert
