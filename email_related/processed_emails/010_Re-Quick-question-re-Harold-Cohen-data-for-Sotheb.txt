Robert, Tom, sorry for being out of touch,I just got to Boston.

I think our best option is to tell the whole story. If we were stamp
collectors, errors like this would be worth a fortune. The story as I
understand it leaves no doubt that "2002" was an error. Here's the
evidence:

 - The left side of the print identifies the work as 03-11-32 (Tom,
 correct me if I misremember the order of the pairs), which means 2003,
 November, 32nd print of the year
 - Another print in the sale was printed at nearly the same time. On the
 left it says 03-11-35. On the right it says 2003.
 - Harold compiled a catalog of work in 2004. In that catalog, the print
 is given the date 2003.
 - We might be able to find an exhibition catalog that shows the print
 and gives it the date 2003. Tom is looking now.
 - Most importantly, Aaron simply couldn't have made this image in 2002.
 Tom's research shows that potted plants happened in 2003 and, notably,
 shadows didn't appear until the summer of 2003.

All this evidence and Harold's well-known inability to keep track of days
and dates leave no doubt in my mind that "2002" is an error. The Trust
can stand confidently behind this account. Far from raising questions
about the dates of the other prints, the research that went into resolving
this anomaly should convince Sotheby's and collectors that we are very
serious about the dates.
