So the site is technically live but it does seem to pop up that coming soon
page on some devices. It works for me on desktop but not mobile. Not sure
if there is a cache issue on the host/device end, something with the domain
name pointing/DNS, indexing or what. If go to a subpage on the site it
seems to work fine:
https://haroldcohentrust.org/about/
Can navigate the whole site except the home page page, which leads me to
think it is something with the hosting/WordPress...

Anyway, I will keep working on it and let you know when resolved.
