A friend of Ed's found what looks like the color separation negatives for
printing the First AI Coloring Book. No idea how they ended up in Japan,
but Ed thinks it happened around the Tskuba exhibition. Sasaki, Ed's
friend, somehow got them and has kept them, and is now I suppose getting on
and downsizing. So he's going to send them to us.

Sara, I might need your help writing the right kind of thank you note.
