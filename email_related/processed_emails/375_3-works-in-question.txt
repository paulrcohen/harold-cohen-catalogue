Hi Paul,As you know we have a shipment to Gazelli in process. Before the works go, I took the opportunity to ask Erin (Harold’s previous assistant) about 3 works that are significantly different than the other portraits style works. Prior to reaching out to her, I dug into the matter and based on what I found I put the dates at 2001 for all 3. All the other works are 1991 to 1998. After contacting Erin, she was able to verify that one of the works was generated in 2001 and thus adding credence to my findings. She wasn’t sure about the other two. She did however make the following comment, “I did not paint them. Nor did I see Harold paint them.” I have found digital files with similar imagery. I am not sure what we do about sending or not sending these as they may not actually be Harold Cohen works.
