Hi Paul,Please find attached my invoice for hours worked in February 2025. 
I put together a catalog of digital works for the year 2000. In the process, I translated the 13 previously unviewable AARON composition. First into SVG and then converted it them to jpegs. Some of the 13 were file fragments. Even so, both complete files and fragments are in included in the catalog. I also included all of the screenshots and other digital files I could find in our archives. The catalog also has background information and other details I know regarding the 2000 works. You can view it here. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nYuHGWIfbPW9dlNVppT6yCs2_HPH3zNcZS2tuTcPrec/edit?usp=sharing
We have a pile of undated printouts. This catalog gives a clear idea which styles belong to 2000. And thus, will be help a in identifying those works. I plan on doing the same for year 2001. Starting in 2002, Harold began to save the AARON composition in multiple formats including jpegs. So we already there is a good idea of what was produced in 2002. But 2001 is still somewhat vague. And like 2000, 2001 has many unviewable AARON composition files. Files that need translating. 
I have been doing a similar catalog for the entire 1990s with the focus on all the intangible works from that decade. Intangible meaning the handful of digital files we have plus all the 35mm screenshots. This is a work in progress but can be viewed herehttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pyeO-NdrtvDaauQaAznAQK-WWs-K5b6BgoHuIQAutY4/edit?usp=sharing

I got the following email from Nina  Karavasiles former HC assistantTom,Yesterday I was speaking to Brett Stalbaum. He is a professor at UC that Harold helped to get in (I think). He had mentioned that the faculty wanted to have a showing of Harold's work at the UC gallery, but couldn't afford it. I said I would ask you if it was possible to have a show with a lesser cost, not through the museum.If this is a question for Paul, please give me his email or phone contact.
I know there was talk before about put the Whitney show on the road. I there is interest from our side be in Whitney style or something else I can do some preliminary reach out. Let me know your thoughts. 
I am waiting for an insurance document from Gazelli so we can look at it before taking the next step for the shipment. I haven’t heard from Micheal. If I don’t hear from him in the morning, I will reach out to him.
