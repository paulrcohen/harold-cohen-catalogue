Hi All,If we do decide to participate, I’d be happy to support. Too bad it is such short notice. I am not sure how any of this fits into the longer term goals. I believe Bre still has AARON files in reserve that were not plotted at the Whitney. That and/or Paul’s Maze reconstruction running on Bre’s plotter would certainly have the potential to still the show. 
If we want to piggyback and highlight the efforts you are currently doing (Gazelli) or plan to preview in the near future, maybe we have similar work here in the studio that is ready to hang and that is not part of the shipment to Gazelli. In any case, like I said if we do decide to participate, I’d be happy to support.Tom
