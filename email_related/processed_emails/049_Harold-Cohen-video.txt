Hey folks,

We shot this video footage over a year ago and it got a wall until I hired
a pro editor to pull a story out of 12 hours or so of footage shot on
phones and multiple camera ms.

Battles with peaking audio, auto white balance challenges and way too much
material and here we are!

I’m happy with this and I’ve watched this many many times with the editor
it is time to publish. We are working on the subtitles and then it will be
ready to go live sometime this week.

I’ll ping you again when it’s live so you can broadcast it to your family
friends and network but wanted to give you the sneak peek.
