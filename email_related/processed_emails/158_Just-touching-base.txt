Hi Paul!

It's been awhile since we've chatted.
Debbie and I still have not come down to earth since the exhibit. We've now
completed all the photo books, distributed all the t-shirts and postcards
and organized all other memorabilia.

Any new exciting developments with the Estate?

Did you attend the Electric Dreams exhibit at the Tate? Harold's artwork at
the Tate is terrific.

Did the Whitney send you the drawings from the exhibit? We were hoping that
we might get some to add to our collection.

Take care,

Bob & Debbie
