Hi Mila and George,
Hope you both are having a good February. 

I don’t know if you still have Dr Thomas Gruber’s Machine Painting or not. But in case you do, I’d like to share the following discovery. In our 1996 VHS video of the BBC One show, “It’ll Never Work”, we can see Dr Gruber’s Machine Painting being executed. The 4 ½ minute segment is chopped up and not necessarily presented chronologically but it does show the work being made from start to end in pieces. The segment starts at 4m01s and goes to 8m34s. A partial view of our Machine Painting TCM#19 (i24-0076) is visible shown as a completed work. Also visible during the segment are 2 Amsterdam drawings, multiple Early People drawings and multiple 1990s paintings. Please find attached a slide showing half dozen screenshots from the TV show showing the work's progression from start to end. And here the link to the video for your viewing. Again it starts at 4minutes. Tom
