 Hi Brig and Paul,

 Sometimes you get lucky. I am looking at Harold's digital files from
 Quickbooks that go back to Jan 1988. Unfortunately, we don't have
 Quickbooks to open it properly. But, using a text editor I believe I
 found the entry we are looking for. 

 900125__o&gt;h_ch_ich_10000.00_gordon bell_ptg "on gauguin's beach"_

 The way I read the entry is that he sold the ptg (painting) to
 Gordon Bell and received a check for $10,000. The entry of the date
 is 1/25/1990 and the amount is close to what Paul recalled. 
 &nbsp;
 In quick books a few days earlier I see these additional entries
 that seem to be related to the delivery,
 900108__mcc&gt;o_mc_tra_46.76_harris ranch_lunch, taking ptg to
 Bells. corp to repay_
 900107__mch&gt;o_mc_tra_24.51_harris ranch_lunch, bell delivery_
 900108__mch&gt;o_mc_tra_19.79_harris ranch_lunch, bell delivery_

 I feel confident that we could generate a bill of sale for you based
 on this historical information. I will, however, also now look into
 the hard files for further confirmation.

 Hi George,

 Would you be able to appraise&nbsp;Meeting on Gauguin's Beach&nbsp;for
 insurance purposes?

 Tom,

 I
 don’t have the invoice for this painting. I inherited it from
 Gordon and Gwen Bell, who were its&nbsp;original owners. Do you have a
 copy of the invoice for this? It would be from 1988 or
 possibly a year or two later.

 Thanks
 everyone for all your help.

 Regards,
 Brig

 Hi both,&nbsp;
 I received a quote from Michael Maloney and have
 attached it below. I rather think working with George
 Barker is the way to go. It's nice to have Maloney's quote
 as a reference for the future.
