Dear Micheal,This is Tom Machnik of the Harold Cohen Trust. Back in 2016 and 2017 you did an appraisal of our inventory after Harold Cohen’s passing. We have a request from an individual who has one of Harold Cohen’s paintings. He is planning to move the painting from California to Colorado and is seeking an appraisal of the work in order to insure it properly for transport. Is this something you could do for him? If not, do you have a recommendation of someone who could a proper appraisal?
