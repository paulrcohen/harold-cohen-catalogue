Dear Michael and Mila,
I am a bit confused and need clarification as to what you would like me 
to do.

I understand a client is coming to LA and wants to see a work in person. 
I am not clear if you want to show "In AARON'S Garden #4 1/10" or 
something else. I say this because I checked our studio inventory and 
cannot find an In AARON's Garden #4 1/10 (IAG#4-1/10). I checked with 
Micheal and apparently (IAG#4-1/10) is there. Therefore, I surmise that 
you don't want me to send (IAG#4-1/10) to Tuxedo Terrace. I was also not 
able to find any additional IAG#4-x/10 signed works. It might be 
possible that we have a test print but I am not sure and certainly no 
idea of its size or condition. So before I search for that can you 
clarify what you were hoping for me to send to Tuxedo Terrace? And I'd 
be happy to accommodate.

Tom
