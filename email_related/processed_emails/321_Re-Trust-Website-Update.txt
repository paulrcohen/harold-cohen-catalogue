Hi Daniel, it looks great! I look forward to iterating with you on little
adjustments but overall I think Harold would be thrilled and proud of it.

Can I ask two things, please. First, please invoice the HCT for the work.
Second, if you are willing to continue on the project, then I'd like to
have a zoom call with you and Sascha, who is CTO at Verisart. Briefly the
idea is to publish two catalogs raisonne, one a handsome print volume that
doesn't include everything, the other an exhaustive, searchable listing
accessible from the HCT web site. The question is whether Verisart can
serve records to the web site easily. If so, then 1) everything can be on
chain, 2) we can augment Verisart records with information they cannot
currently handle, such as Tom's provenance notes or facsimiles of
exhibition catalogs. I think we should run a little experiment to see
whether Verisart can serve a record when requested from the HCT website
client. I might also be totally off-base about the right way to get the
functionality we want! If you are interested, can you suggest some times
we might chat with Sascha, keeping in mind the eight-hour time difference.

Beautiful work, thank you!
