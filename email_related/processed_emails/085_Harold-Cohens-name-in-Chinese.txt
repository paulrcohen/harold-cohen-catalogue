Hi both,

Have a few separate topics to send over to you (as well as getting back to
you re IAG) so bear with me.

This one's a particular request that I wondered if you have anything in
your records for - did Harold Cohen ever have an official Chinese name?
Perhaps from any exhibitions in the region they've translated his name as.
It's from the Taikang museum, who are featuring Harold Cohen's work in a
show William Latham is curating, opening next month. They are distributing
material in two languages so want to make sure it matches what is already
out there. I tried searching for it but nothing came up.

My best,
Mila
