Hi MilaRegarding other works in the same edition as being signed, we dont necessarily have the historical information available to provide a complete picture. I do know at least one of the (2 of 3) prints is now with the V&A. I'm assuming if it at the V&A and it is 2 of 3 then there is a high likelihood of it being signed. I also know when I was looking for some of the historical info on the 9 I did come across references works being exhibited as of 3 of 3. Like said we dont have the documents to provide a complete picture. 
As for wording maybe something likeAs with all of Harold Cohen's AARON works each is unique. Here we offer a signed edition. 
Although I am not too sure about this wording. It's just a thought of trying to define what unique means in this context. 
I will look for some additional references
