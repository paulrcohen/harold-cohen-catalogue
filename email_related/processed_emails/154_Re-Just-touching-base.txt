Hi Paul ... Thanks for the update on your travels and future events for the
Whitney exhibit. It would be exciting to see it travel.

Zach is thriving at Bantam. He loves working there. He's like a kid in a
large candy store! Even has a new girlfriend (from NY city) and it looks
like it's fairly serious. We recently visited Peekskill and had the
opportunity to meet her. We were impressed!

As regards the hurricanes, the last one, Milton's center eye, came directly
at us. Lots of damage especially to our barrier islands. We survived in
our 9th floor condo (located in downtown Sarasota on Sarasota Bay) and were
especially lucky in that we never lost power, internet etc although all the
other condos in our neighborhood did. It's been almost two months and the
city is still trying to recover.

Congrats on your daughter's marriage! We did meet her at the reception
dinner but only for a few minutes. Sounds like she is smart like her Dad
and just as charming.

Boston is a great city. Did you know that there are several universities in
that area that would love to hire a prof with your bio!

Lastly, we'd love to have some of the Whitney drawings. If possible, how
about 10 from each of the plotters (total 20) and one from each plotter
(total 2) signed by the three famous Harold Cohen supporters. Of course,
please send the shipping costs and where I should send payment.

Our address:

Bob & Debbie Hendel
401 S. Palm Ave., Unit 903
Sarasota, FL 34236

Mobile 917 301 9665

THANKS!

Bob & Debbie
