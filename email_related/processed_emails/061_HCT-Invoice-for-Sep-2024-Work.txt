Hi Paul,Please find attached my invoice for Sep 2024 work. Of course during Sep most of the effort was toward the Sotheby's Oct 2024 project. We learned much because of the endeavor. One the things I learned was that our digital records need to be all collected and put all onto one storage device. Previously I collected the source code and put that all on one storage device. But the AARON generated artwork, HC correspondences, notes and other files were not. When it came to researching the Sotheby project it because obvious that we need to copy all of what we have into ideally one storage media. And that media should have multiple backups. This is what my primary focus is now and where most of my time is being spent. I am currently pulling all the original storage devices and copying everything to make the initial master copy. Ideally it would be sorted and such but that can be done as needed. For now I need to copy everything while things still work. 

Tom
