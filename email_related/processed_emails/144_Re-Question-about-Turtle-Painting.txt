Hi George,

I am not sure I understand the question correctly. So, just to be clear, of the three shows you mention, there are “no" known works that exist–  at all – that were composed and executed at any of these shows. 

If we are referring to canvas works, there were 3 executed after these shows. One is now at the Tate. One is with Thoma. And we sent you the 3rd one. We have a 4th canvas work that is black lines only in the studio – no coloring. I did a detailed investigation for Valentina Ravaglia of the Tate into their work (RA26) for their Electric Dreams which you can view here if interested. 

RA26 (Oct 1979) - A Deeper Look

Shortly after I began working for Harold, he had me destroy a canvas work which may have been from that same period. But I really don’t know. It might have been more recent. 

We have a tiny collection of early non-canvas works. These are folded cloth works. Some are multi-panel-mural works, others a single panel. I hope to get to document them this year. The time period range of these works is not known but I rather think they are late 1970s early 1980s. 

If there are additional works out there, I am not aware of them. When I looked into the details and origins of the Tate’s RA26, I did not come across any information suggesting more than the known 4 canvas works were executed in the 1977-1979 style of AARON. 

Hope that helps, if you need anything else let me know,

Tom

 Hi Tom and Paul, 
I hope you are both doing well? 
Aside from the Tate, do you know how many of the large Turtle paintings are in museum or public collections? Shows at that time include Documenta 6, group show (1977), Stedejilk, solo show (1977) and SFMoMA, solo (1979). 
Really appreciate your help, as always! 
George
