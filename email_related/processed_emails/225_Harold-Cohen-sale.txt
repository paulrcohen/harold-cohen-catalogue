Hello both

Hope you're keeping well. I've just seen the Sotheby's catalogue for the Harold Cohen sale and thought I should get in touch.

 I see that they've now updated the online description for 0305-08, which was incorrect until recently. For information I acquired a copy of this for the museum in 2005, along with a copy of 0305-03 (no. 2 of 5 - not in the Sotheby's catalogue).

Both are illustrated in the small Digital Pioneers catalogue produced for the V&A's show in 2009 (nos. 41-42). 0305-03 was also exhibited in a V&A exhibition entitled Prints Now and is illustrated in the accompanying book, p. 11.

Several of the other works in the Sotheby's sale have appeared in print or online too, but I don't know whether copies of any of them were ever acquired by anyone.

Best wishes
