Folks, here's a thought about strategy for folios. Please let me know what
you think:

Define a folio to be a collection of prints that have some coherence (e.g.,
AG1 - AG12)

Define a reference folio to be a folio that can be used as reference
material for reprinting or by scholars etc. Note that a reference folio
can contain damaged works provided the damage does not prevent the
reference material being used as intended. Note also that a reference
folio need not be signed.

As with individual works, we should *never* sell the reference folio.

That's the easy part. Now the harder part concerns selling work from
nonreference folios. Here we need guidance from Mila. I think we could
make the argument that we should not break up the last of a folio, unless
the prices warrant it or there is no prospect of selling the entire folio
as a unit. Suppose we have two copies of a folio (e.g., two undamaged
copies of each of the 12 prints in AG), then I would argue that we can sell
from one of these folios.

What do you think?
