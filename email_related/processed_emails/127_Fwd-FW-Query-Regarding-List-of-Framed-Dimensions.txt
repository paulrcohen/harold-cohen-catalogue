Hi Michael
There seems to be some typos on both documents. Here is a link to the 
most accurate measurements.
I'm not sure how precise they need to be. Some of the measurements on 
the Sotheby sheet are only 1/16 or 1/8 inch off.
I am will be updating the spreadsheet later today.

But in case you need it now, here is the link to the files on the HCT 
Google Drive. But, I also attached them here in case that is easier.
Ana also has access to the files on the Google Drive.
