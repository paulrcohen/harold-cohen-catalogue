Doug, this is great news, I am so glad! Thank you for replying so quickly and positively. I’ll send the three-pager a bit later this week. Thanks again! —Paul

>> Hi Doug, first I must apologize for a very close deadline. I just learned of this opportunity from the Schmidt Sciences <https://schmidtsciences.smapply.io/prog/humanities_and_artificial_intelligence_virtual_institute_havi_/> foundation. A few months ago I proposed to one of the LLM companies a “21st Century Catalogue Raisonne” built around Harold. That proposal looks like it will go forward, but slowly, so I am proposing the same to Schmidt, except I want to build something not just for Harold’s CR but for any artist who wants it. I am trying to assemble a consortium of experts on very short notice and I am hoping that I can tempt you to participate. Christiane Paul and Mila are on board, as are Bre Pettis and Tom Machnik. I’m trying to get in touch with Pip Laurensen but no luck so far.

I have attached the original proposal to the LLM company (please don’t share it) to give you a sense of what the Schmidt pre-proposal will say.
