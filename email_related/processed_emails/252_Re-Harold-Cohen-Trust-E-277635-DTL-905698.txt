Dear Jeremy,
Regarding a date, will you be sending someone prior to collection to assess the care requirements? For example we have a number of large dye on paper works that or loose and will need pre-packing before shipping. We have other works that are order an in need of pre-packing TLC. Â The studio is behind the home of family that is part of the Trust. We need to limit the time between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm. If you are able to do pre-packing onsite and complete the work all on one day between those times Monday June 16th is available.
