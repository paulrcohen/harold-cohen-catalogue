Hi Paul,

Apologies for the late response.
Sending you the signed contract, where it does not specify the uniqueness
of the work.
Let me speak to Michael again given the information Tom sent through in the
other thread. I think backing out of the auction at this late stage would
be more harmful for our relationship with Sotheby's which we want to keep
for future potential sales.

Will revert with news,
Mila
