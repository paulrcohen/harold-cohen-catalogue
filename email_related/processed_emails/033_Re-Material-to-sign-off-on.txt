Tom will say when each AA file was created. Then the AA files were transformed to JPEGs. This happened later, mostly in 2005. Tom will say when it happened for each work. However, for one work, Harold's JPEG was corrupted. Tom found a postscript file for that work and created a JPEG for it in 2024. The JPEG has the same parameters (reflected in the metadata) as the originals. The provenance will identify Tom as Harold's Studio Manager.
