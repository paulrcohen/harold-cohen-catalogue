Dear Thomas

Thank you for contacting the BBC Archives.

I can tell you that the material described in your documents relates to two different programmes, one TV and one radio.

The TV programme was called “Sunday Night: Five for Venice”, this was shown on BBC1 on 25 September 1966. Unfortunately this programme no longer exists in the BBC Archives.

The other programme was broadcast in a series called “Some American Artists” on 20 March 1967 on BBC radio (Network Three, one of the forerunners of Radio 3), although it looks like it was probably recorded two years earlier as per your information. This programme does exist in the BBC Archives.

Apart from this item, we also have some later programmes which feature Harold Cohen, which we can give you details of if required.

We may be able to give you access to these existing programmes to view or listen to for research purposes, if you are looking to use them beyond that we would need details of what use you proposed to make of them, and we can advise what may be possible based on that.

Kind regards

Andrew Martin
