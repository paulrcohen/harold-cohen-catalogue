Dear Pegah,

I was unaware of the upcoming Christie's auction as I was probably not in the loop. No matter, I will do what I can with the allotted time available. Understanding does change over time and therefore this reply is based on the current understanding. I attached a memo Harold wrote in 1993. His memo addresses the work from the same time period as the i23-3758 up for auction at Christie’s. These clarifications regarding Harold’s work tend to be tricky. One of the problems with the word “Series” in English is that series is both singular and plural. Please keep that in mind. 

In the memo below, Harold writes about two main phases of AARON, Primitive and Knowledgable. The first of these two Harold called “Primitive”. Time wise Primitive works are Pre-1980. The second phase he called “Knowledgable" (Post-1980). The Knowledgable phase is the one that i23-3758 belongs to. According to his memo, 1980s can basically be cut in half. The first half (1980-1985) Harold does not name but I will call Early Knowledge. The second half Harold called is the “provision of a physical ambience” or I will called Ambience for short.  And 1985 is basically transitional. In 1985 Harold begins the transition by developing human figures in motion. This is quickly followed by him adding Ambience for the human figures. First we see Statues of Liberty figures, then the Athletes and the Bathers. And then later we see works like i23-3758.

In his memo Harold refers to AARON as having the knowledge to generate anything from a quasi-daisy to a quasi oak-tree. A collection of these qausi-plants becomes the ambience. He claims that this knowledge was capable of providing for a very large number of drawings and that this group was referred to as “Eden Series.” Unfortunately, it is difficult to know if series is singular or plural. He then says that some friends refer to these works as "Yuppies in the Jungle." 

Based on Harold’s memo, I rather think the two terms “Eden Series” and “Yuppies in the Jungle” are interchangeable. However, in the studio where items are labelled, there is a specific group of works identified as Yuppies in the Jungle or YIJ. Also in the studio there are multiple groups of works labelled as “Jungle Drawings.”  Not to add to the confusion, there is also a (2013) painting titled Eden. This later work is one of a group of works where Harold revisited earlier works. 

So, based on the way I interpret what Harold wrote, the i23-3758 is both from the Eden Series (where series is plural noun) and from the Jungle Drawing series (series as a singular noun). Eden seems to be more of an umbrella group of multiple series of works. And where Jungle Drawings is a subset series of Eden. 

This is the best reply I can provide at this time. Let me know if you have any questions,

Tom
