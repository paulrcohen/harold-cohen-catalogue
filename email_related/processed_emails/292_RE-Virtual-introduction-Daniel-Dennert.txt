Thanks so much for connecting us, Christiane! Moving you to BCC.

Paul and Tom, nice to meet you—and thank you for the quick response. As Christiane mentioned, I’m the curator for the arts program at San Diego International Airport. One of my roles is organizing temporary exhibitions that showcase contemporary art from the region. These are themed exhibitions that bring together a variety of artists in dialogue around a central idea.

We’re currently developing concepts for upcoming shows, and as more San Diego-based artists explore the use of AI as a creative partner, we thought it would be timely to feature that subject. Given Harold Cohen’s pioneering contributions to the field—and his connection to San Diego—we wanted to reach out about potential ways to incorporate his work or legacy as a thread in the exhibition.

I’d love to set up a time to talk. Would you be available next week—either Thursday between 3:30–5:00 PM or Friday after 1:00 PM?

Thanks so much,
Daniel
