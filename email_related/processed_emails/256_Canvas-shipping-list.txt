Dear both,

Please find enclosed a link to our proposed shipping list for the
figurative canvases that are currently in Encinitas, to be sent alongside
the unrolled works in Tom's previous email:
https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/f5fcb1f56f9ce5a013b84a/

Can we please also have the remaining Painting Machine works you have there
too? New pricing TBC.

We agreed to set the retail price of HC2477, HC2448, HC4426 and HC4427 at
£150,000. I think it would be beneficial to sell one work in the new year,
leaving three for the fairs.

The plan was to market some of them at Dallas Art Fair and Armoury NYC in
2025, alongside a selection of other Cohen works. At this stage, we would
still need to be invited/apply to both fairs, and the longer term goal is
Frieze and Basel in 2026.

Are we ok to price the first available large one at £300,000? And then
increase the price by 100k until the third one is £500,000? It looks like
there are 15 or so large ones, compared with 10 medium sized ones.

Regarding a cursory stock-check of all figurative canvases, both in London
and California, I have counted 29 in total. There are 4 not listed on AL,
but found via a PDF on our shared drive (attached). We are hoping that
Tom's rolled canvases yield some more.

I think we'd need to get the shipping process up and running as soon as we
can.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

George
