Dear Thomas

The Open University programme with the course code M206/TV10 has the BBC programme number FOUM535A and is subtitled “Artware”, this was transmitted on 29 April 1997 (NB not 24 April).

The Tate Gallery item does appear to have been filmed in the Gallery itself, there is no indication on the BBC paperwork exactly when the filming took place but it is likely to have been on the day of transmission or very shortly before.

Kind regards

Andrew

Dear Andrew,
Thank you for the list. I know it is not much but every little be helps. I am familiar with "It'll Never Work" as we have this programme on VHS tape. We also have a VHS tape of "Knowledge Talks: The Turing Test" but I did not have the date of the work so the date was very helpful. In regards to "Open University: Artware..." We have a tape with a printed label. Some of the text is difficult to read but it might read as:
A.LAW BBC OPEN UNIVERSITY ?OUM535A M206/TV10
This is a PAL format VHS and since we only have NTSC equipment I have yet to view it. There is a date of on the tape being 17/1/97. Based on this limited information, can you tell if this is the same programme as the Open University 24/04/97? If not, might you be able tell me what this programme is about?

In regards to the Newsnight 07/06/83 programme. This the first time to learn of this one. Cohen was in London around that time for a show at the Tate. Can you tell if the "Item on Computer Art" was filmed at the Tate Museum on our about the date of airing? In other words, is there a way to know where & when the filming took place?
