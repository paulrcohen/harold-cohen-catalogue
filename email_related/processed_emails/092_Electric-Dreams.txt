Hi both,

It was a real pleasure to meet yesterday evening at the Electric Dreams
opening.

As I mentioned I am a big admirer of Harolds work and have so enjoyed
digging into his various writings and the context of his work and journey
with AARON.

I am also eager to share his pioneering story with the world and am in the
early stages of developing a documentary with the former Head of Arts and
Music at the BBC.

Paul - you kindly mentioned sharing the contact information of Harolds
studio assistant, i'm sure they would be a fantastic help as we start to
flesh out the material.
