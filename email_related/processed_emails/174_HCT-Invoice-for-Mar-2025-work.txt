Hi Paul,Please find attached my invoice for March 2025 work. Hopefully, the shipment to be going to Gazelli soon. I sent the document you signed to Michael and I am waiting to hear from him. I was able to figure out the color code scheme Harold used for most of his 2001 aa file (aa=aaron file formatted files). There are 94 of them. About 1/2 dozen are different in some way so they are not yet translated. Also not yet attempt to translate are files listed as dd. There are 64 dd files from 2001. Below are some links to documents I made related to year 2001.

Work in process — Catalog of 2001 works In this document I have all the known jpegs that Harold made from AARON files which is a count of 16. I also included snapshots of the 4 works we have from 2001 that are signed. I started putting the 94 translated one in this document. I also plan on including the various AARON versions from 2001 that we have. I am still working on figuring this out as there are quite a few there may be as many as 12. Here is the link to the 2001 Catalog https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cz-FjPaMlNeA2jYbnwEbTMVpfWQrhw4X6aiu_Zsf4sQ/edit?usp=sharing
