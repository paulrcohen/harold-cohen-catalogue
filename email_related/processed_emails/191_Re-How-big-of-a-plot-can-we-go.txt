A few things here. Aidan wrote a script on a virtual machine and let it run
for a day or two.

We then batch converted the files to strip out the color and converted them
to gcode and rotated the portrait ones to fit in the machine. We made 5600
drawings. I think we made it through less than 2000 KCAT drawings.

I think we did something like 10k maze drawings but my memory is hazy
there.

For the direct control we built a process based on Paul’s work to generate
work every morning. This proved to be more complicated for the operators
and they ended up generating new drawings every morning but then running
drawings from a different folder thus drawing the same drawings everyday.
After that, we generated something like 10k mazes and I think we had
folders with dates on them.

There was some sorcery involved to have it be drawing on the screen and on
the machine at the same time.

The project that I would love to do with you would be a book of Harold
cohen KCAT plants. My favorite drawings are the ones with plants and second
favorite are the plants and people.

These files are easy to find because if you sort by file size the plants
are a lot bigger files.

Paul Rickards, who is an awesome artists went down a rabbit hole and
adapted the KCAT drawings to a cmyk approach. He processes the KCAT output
with python code. He gave me two of these as a gift. I’m not at the office
but can send you a pic later.

If you want to do a Plants of Harold Cohen book or exhibition project I’d
like to help!
