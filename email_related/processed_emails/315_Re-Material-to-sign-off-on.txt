Mila, I think that attestation only works if we consider others to be
artist proofs. When did this requirement arise? It’s the first I’ve heard
of it. In effect it precludes us from selling others, even when we know
Harold intended the work to be editioned. I assume we can sell new
prints but not those Harold made. It’s very restrictive and way, way too
late to impose it now. P
