Dear Pegah,
Glad to know Pamela McCorduck did not contradict what I wrote. It was helpful to review this as I learned the name of the two paths of Harold’s l1980’s development. One being the human figure in motion and the other was the provision of a physical ambience. 
Thanks for Christies auction dates.
