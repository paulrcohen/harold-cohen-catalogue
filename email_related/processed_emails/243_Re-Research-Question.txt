Hi Tom,
So nice to hear from you! It's been the dream of curators, museum staff, and the digital art world, in particular, to have an archive or meta-data interoperability to be able to trace an artist's work across institutional collections. Sadly, initiatives so far haven't gone anywhere, so we are all stuck with tracing works in individual collections. The registrar or staff in the registrar's department are typically the best people to contact.

When it comes to private collectors donating to institutions or reselling, the situation tends to be even worse. I think in this case the use of NFTs as certificate of authenticity could play a valuable role Â— at least the transfer of a work from one owner to another could be transparently traced.

I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
All the best,
Christiane
