Hi Michael,If you are ready, you are welcome to connect me with the shipper. I know typically the shipper would like to come and check it all out before sending the pickup crew. I have all the work staged in the studio for them at this time. There is a question about a few works that may or may not be sent. But that will be resolved soon. So basically everything is ready to go.
Tom
