Hi George, Happy Monday!
I came across a video you might be interested in viewing dated December 1980. And while it is not the Holy Grail video of the Turtle in action, it does bring us a half step closer to seeing the elusive Turtle crawling. This video does have a recorded-live segment of AARON generating a Turtle Era work on the computer terminal. Also, I recently read an old correspondence written by Becky Cohen. In the letter she claims that the they had received a video tape of the 1977 Stedelijk Museum show. But unfortunately they could not find a machine that could play the tape. Apparently at that time the US had a different video format than what was being used in the Netherlands. She latter claimed in the letter that she was returning the video. I believe she was returning it in the hopes the video could be converted in the Netherlands for viewing in the US. I haven’t found a reply so I don’t know if a viewable video was returned. However, this does tell me that I video was made so there is still hope!
Here is the youtube link to the video of AARON running back in 1980. He also speaks of the Murals he was executing at the time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcnZegsQjYA

Have a great week,Tom
