Hi Mr. Martin, I am writing to thank you for your help and to introduce
myself. I am Harold Cohen's son and the trustee of the Harold Cohen
Trust. Harold's work is seeing a resurgence of interest with an exhibition

and another planned in London at the Gazelli Art House
<https://gazelliarthouse.com/artists/harold-cohen/biography/>, which
represents Harold. Tom Machnik and other members of the Trust are trying
