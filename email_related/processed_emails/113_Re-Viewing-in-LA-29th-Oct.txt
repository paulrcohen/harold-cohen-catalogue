Hi Paul,

Yes, by breaking I mean we would no longer have 2 of each. I was 
thinking that if in the future someone would want to acquire the entire 
IAG Series we would potentially jeopardize that opportunity buy selling 
one. I know that leaves one but that would make it the last one and we 
would lose the reference for any potential reprints in the future.

As for more editions in the series that have more than two. I went back 
and looked at the originals and it turns out that the ones with more 
than 2 are damaged in some way. Here is the breakdown

IAG#1   4 total, 2 ok, 2 damaged
IAG#2   2 total, 2 ok
IAG#3   2 total, 2 ok
IAG#4   2 total, 2 ok
IAG#5   2 total, 2 ok
IAG#6   3 total, 2 ok, 1 damaged
IAG#7   4 total, 2 ok, 2 damaged
IAG#8   4 total, 2 ok, 2 damaged
IAG#9   3 total, 2 ok, 2 damaged
IAG#10 4 total, 2 ok. 2 damaged
IAG#11 4 total, 2 ok. 2 damaged
IAG#12 4 total, 2 ok. 2 damaged
