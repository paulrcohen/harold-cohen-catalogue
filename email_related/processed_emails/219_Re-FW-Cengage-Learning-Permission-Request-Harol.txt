Hi Micah, thanks for getting in touch. Gijon is a computer program. Last
year, the Whitney bought one copy of an edition (five, if I remember
rightly) for its collection. It isn't clear what Cengage wants. Imagery
is one thing, code another. It would be contrary to the spirit of our
agreement with WMAA to let Cengage have the code. I am certainly willing to
talk with them, and I appreciate your offer to put us in touch. Thanks,
