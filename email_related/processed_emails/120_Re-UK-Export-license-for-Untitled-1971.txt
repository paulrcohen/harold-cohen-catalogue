Hi Paul,

Thanks for the update, I appreciate it.

I'm not sure how many more Painting Machine works you guys have, but I
remember we didn't ship everything to London last time..? Understanding how
many figurative works on canvas you have is important, so if you wouldn't
mind confirming which ones you have, aside from this list that would be
great: https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/f5fcb1f56f9ce5a013b84a/ we'd
like to ship them all over.

Thanks everyone !

George
