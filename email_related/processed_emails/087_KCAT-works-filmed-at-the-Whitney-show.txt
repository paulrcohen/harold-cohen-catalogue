Hi Christiane,
I hope your year is off to a good start and that you are involved with exciting enjoyable efforts. Hard to believe a year has past already since we were there with you at your incredible Whitney evident for Harold and his AARON. 
I am currently working on identifying AARON works executed during the Harold’s transition period away from the painting machine toward his use of wide-format commercial printers (1998-2002). At the moment, I am focusing on Harolds year 2000 efforts — just prior to KCAT’s release. There is this one digital image that seems like an outlier. Based on the imagery it seems to belong to June of 2000 except for one stylistic feature — the nose.  
I know that after the initial KCAT release, Harold began an effort to remove all the black lines. The earliest dated evidence I have seen of the lines being removed is May 2001. This artwork has no people though. The earliest dated evidence we have of people without the line drawing is Oct of 2001. After Oct 2001, the lines are completely gone until 2012. 
I recall Harold commenting in particular about the line used to make the nose and how to handle its removal. From that view point it might be possible that the work in question was a kind of transitional/experiment work of his. A transitional work that would be post KCAT and pre-line removal. And if so, maybe he used an earlier 2000 AARON version to do an experiment. This is just a guess. Ideally, I find other examples of this nose prior to May 2001. 
When I look through our people with faces works (1990’s to 2001), I have yet to find a nose like this one. AARON did have the capacity to generate a wide range of variety and I haven’t necessarily seen the extent of its variety. Your Whitney show did produce a large number of works. In fact we have many of them here in the studio. I believe looking through this collection will help me resolve this issue and possibly others to come. 
We do plan on photographing the works you sent to us sometime in the future, I am wondering if there is a way to look through the Whitney KCAT collection without having to do so physically and prior to photographing them.
I would appreciate any thoughts you have on this matter.
