Tom, I appreciate that you have collected at one example of a work for
which we cannot truthfully assert that it is unique. But I suggest you not
waste time finding others until Sotheby's says *exactly* which assertion
about the works they require from us and point to the contract language
that justifies the requirement.

We gave them an easy solution: Each print + JPEG is a unique entity, even
if there are other prints out there. If they choose to reject this
interpretation of unique and impose another that is not required by
contract, then they are at fault. In any case, the ball is in their court.
