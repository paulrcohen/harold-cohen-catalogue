Hi both ,

They have now just requested to reproduce just the cover of the book (as
realised it will take a little longer to get copyright for other elements
of the book as originally intended).

Would this work? (They are planning to have the title as “The first
artificial colouring book” beside the image of the cover of the book.

If all good, can you please confirm what the credit line should be in this
case?

Best,
Mila
