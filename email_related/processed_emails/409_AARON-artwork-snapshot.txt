Hi Paul,I have attached a snapshot of a framed print. The name of the file is SANY0005.jpg and dated September 21, 2001. I found it mixed in with emails from 2000-2002. I am assuming the SANY of the filename indicates it was from a Sanyo digital camera. Does this happen to look familiar to you? Or have any thoughts regarding this work? Tom
