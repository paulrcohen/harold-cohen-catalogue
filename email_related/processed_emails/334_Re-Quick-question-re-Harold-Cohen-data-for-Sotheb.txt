Hi Paul,

It’s no problem to burn the NFT and re-issue it as it has not been transferred or publicized yet.

Are you OK with this wording?

“The Harold Cohen Trust notes that the artist has signed this print as 2002 but has concluded this was an error. The file name 0311-32 refers to the year 2003, the month November and the 32nd Aaron generated work in that month.'

Thanks

Robert

It is sure to happen again, or something similar that could cause a token to be withdrawn, so I wonder whether there's any general method to deal with these cases. For example, is there any notion of a provisional NFT or does that undermine the whole idea of NFTs. When I buy a house, I sign one contract saying that I intend to buy it, but this isn't the contract that formalizes ownership. That comes later, after various inspections are passed.
