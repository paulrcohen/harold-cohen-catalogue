Brig,

Please find attached a letter from Cambridge Trust Company which 
confirms the $10,000 but unfortunately it does not clearly state the 
painting name. But based on the date being close to the January 25, 1990 
date we can assume its the same painting. The letter is dated Feb 9, 
1990 but the check could have been issued Jan 25th or the 25th could 
have been the invoice date. In any case, I have exhausted the manila 
folders. There are other folders related to DEC and Gordon Bell but none 
have any references to the painting in question. Now that I have the 
Cambridge Trust Company name I can look and see tomorrow if we have any 
additional documents under that name. Regardless, of that outcome we can 
generate a document for you with the information we have.

Tom
