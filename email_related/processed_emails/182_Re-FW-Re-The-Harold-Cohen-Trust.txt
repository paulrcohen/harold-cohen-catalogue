So the lecture took place in Hakodate, which I think you already knew, and
although the introduction of the person initially speaking was cut off, I’m
guessing that’s Mima san. And then the person translating the lecture was
apparently a student of Harold’s, Mukayama?? The audio is muffled and I
can’t make out the name exactly. I know my mom remembers this lecture so I
can ask her. Mima also thanked Mr. Ito (again, not super sure), who is the
president of the art department, as well as the Committee of International
Relations (?) for inviting and helping fund the special lecture. The theme
of the lecture was “somthing something…Imagination in Art” or something
like that? I can’t make out the first part. I didn’t listen to the whole
lecture, but it sounds great! The part in second video at about 48 min in
during the Q &A is so interesting!

Can I share the video with my mom to see if she remembers anything else
pertinent?
