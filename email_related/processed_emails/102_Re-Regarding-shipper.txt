Hello Thomas,

Apologies for the delay here.
The total value requires me to submit these for an additional 'premium', or
specific transit cover.
All the details are with our broker and they should come back to me
tomorrow with confirmation of the 'premium' and a copy of the COI.

Thank you for following up.

Michael.
