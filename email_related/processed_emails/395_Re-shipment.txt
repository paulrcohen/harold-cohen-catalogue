Hi Michael,I checked the items on the list. Just a couple of comments regarding page 10. Not sure this makes a difference or not but with respect to the posters there are more than one. The Brooklyn Museum poster count is 4Arnolfini poster count is 3Natural Museum of Wales count is 5Tate poster count is 8
And with respect to the Tate poster there are 2 entries. I am not sure that is necessary. There are a total of 8 being sent. 
Besides that I compared your list with our list. I then compared both lists to the physical  works. Except for posters, everything matches.

 Hello Thomas,
Thank you for the details.I've drafted the final shipping invoice and attached a copy here for your reference.
I've confirmed this with Brad Davis from Dietl and he should be in touch regarding collection either later today / tomorrow (they have to check their schedule and will work on a mutually convenient day to collect these).
If you could run your eyes over the attached shipping invoice and let me know if you have any concerns, please let me know.Please note that these descriptions and details are simplified for the purposes of customs.
If there are any issues I'll be sure to update you.
Best,
Michael.


 Ok thx!

 Hi Mila,Happy Monday! Regarding a potential visit this week for a preliminary visit or a pickup, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday would be best. Today (Monday would be ok too but since I have not heard anything I assume that is off the table.
