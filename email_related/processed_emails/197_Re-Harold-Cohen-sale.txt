Hi Paul

Nice to hear from you, and I'm glad the information was useful. I imagine it's a nightmare tracking everything Harold produced.

I'll be away for a few days from 24-27 Nov but hopefully we might still be able to meet up!

Best wishes

Doug

Hi Doug, thanks for your email. I hope you are keeping well. Perhaps we'll bump into each other around the Electric Dreams show? I plan to be there for a couple of days.

Thanks for your eagle eye on these prints. The whole experience has been interesting and edifying. Harold didn't keep the best records, so Tom Machnik, Harold's studio manager, cc'd here, labored long to track down editions and provenance. Your notes on the above are super helpful, thank you!

Looking forward to seeing you in late November if you are around.
