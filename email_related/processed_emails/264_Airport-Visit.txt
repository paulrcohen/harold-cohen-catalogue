Hi Paul,I was able to meet with Daniel at the San Diego Airport today and he took me on a tour showing me the spaces. I took some photos which I will upload tomorrow. In general there are two different kind of spaces. One being flat walls — or nearly flat — and the other being big glass cases set into the wall space. The flat spaces could possibly accommodate projection but I am not quite sure because people would be walking by. Daniel seems to think it would be doable so maybe it is. The glass cases are approximately 8 ft high although one might be a bit shorter. The width varies with the biggest around 16 ft. There is one space that people would see as there are going through the TSA queue. This is one of the glass spaces. The remaining spaces are all on the other side after going through TSA. On the way toward the international terminal area is one of the flat wall spaces. Daniel was concerned about using this as a projection space because there tend to be ambient light and shadows on the space. It is quite a good size space though. We don’t have measurement but I suspect it is 20 ft long and the height 6-8ft. Continuing down the hallway into the terminal area there is a seating area with 3 walls surrounding the space. Each wall has glass cases. Electricity is available in each of the cases if necessary. Then down on the opposite side of the terminal there is another flat space and for the current show they had multiple canvas pieces. This space has a low ceiling compared to the others spaces. 
In additional to showing the spaces, Daniel talked about the stipend and because it is quite low he prepared me in advance. He said the stipend would $1,500. However, he said that they would handle all the shipping, handling logistics and insurance. He also said that normally there is a proposal submission process but that he would talk legal to try to get that waved. 
I also asked about timelines and basically whatever would be shown would be picked up sometime in December. And the decision on what would be shown has to be decided by August. 
We did talk about an active plotter. Based on what I saw, any plotter would have to be vertical. And with respect loading paper a roll or some other method would need to be implemented to minimize having to have a person interact with the plotter. I ask Daniel what he thought the maximum interaction with plotter would be. He thought that a maximum of once every two weeks. Although, if the staff at the airport were not involved, he seemed to think it could be more often. 
So that is kind of the summary. 
I am  putting on my thinking cap. At this time, I would prefer the glass cases. Unfortunately having a traditional projection in the cases would not be practical. However, I do see Samsung has interesting solution whereby the image is projected from the floor onto a rolled screen (see link below). Nice idea, but I rather think a more narrow system would be required for the airport cases. If we want to go that route of we’d need a solution that fits inside the case. I do think a mechanical machine would be more engaging. The projections are nice but with the nature of the world today with screens everywhere I wonder if another screen would just be another screen and would get lost. I know we don’t have much time, but I’m wondering if an unconventional solution can be found. A plotter that is more like a etch-a-sketch that doesn’t require paper.  Or one that plots on a white board that can then be erased or something similar. I’m also wondering how we might implement a way for people to have an image as a take-away. I know we don’t have much time, but what if we had an app that worked only in proximity of the display. And if they like the image being generated they could capture it on with the app in some way maybe. Thereby having their own NFT of sorts. An NFT that we would still have control over. 
We could just go with static pieces too. 
 If you want to talk more about it we can.
