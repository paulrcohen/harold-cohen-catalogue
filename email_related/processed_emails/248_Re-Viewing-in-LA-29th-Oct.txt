Dear Mila,

Thanks for your patients. Regarding the clients choice of AARON's Garden #4 1/10, I did not find any signed edition prints in the studio. We do, however, have 2 unsigned prints. These are in the master folio for the IAG Series. I don't know what your thoughts are but since #4 is unsigned we have somethings to consider. But before I mention my thoughts on what to consider, let me answer your other question. 

With respect to the others in your list that are signed, this is what we have and their condition
