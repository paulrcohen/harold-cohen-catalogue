Hi Tom and Paul,

I hope you are both doing well?

Aside from the Tate, do you know how many of the large Turtle paintings are
in museum or public collections? Shows at that time include Documenta 6,
group show (1977), Stedejilk, solo show (1977) and SFMoMA, solo (1979).

Really appreciate your help, as always!

George
