Hi Paul,

Not sure what to do about this email from NBC or future emails like this.
Previous to us having the haroldcohentrust account, media requests would
have gone to GAH first. I am now in the habit of checking this email weekly
but that may not be often enough.

They were or may still be looking for an interview with respect to this
month’s Christie’s AI Auction. The email may be a form type letter as it
sounds like they don’t know Harold has passed. I know there is controversy
surrounding some of the works at auction. Especially programs scanning
previous works and then not crediting the artists who created them. In
my view, AARON seems to be on the opposite spectrum.

Anyway, how should we respond?

Tom
