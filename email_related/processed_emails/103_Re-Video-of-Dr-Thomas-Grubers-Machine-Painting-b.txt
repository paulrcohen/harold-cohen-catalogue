> Hi Mila and George,
> Hope you both are having a good February.

> I don’t know if you still have Dr Thomas Gruber’s Machine Painting or not.
> But in case you do, I’d like to share the following discovery. In our 1996
> VHS video of the BBC One show, “It’ll Never Work”, we can see Dr Gruber’s
> Machine Painting being executed. The 4 ½ minute segment is chopped up and
> not necessarily presented chronologically but it does show the work being
> made from start to end in pieces. The segment starts at 4m01s and goes to
> 8m34s. A partial view of our Machine Painting TCM#19 (i24-0076) is visible
> shown as a completed work. Also visible during the segment are 2 Amsterdam
> drawings, multiple Early People drawings and multiple 1990s paintings.
> Please find attached a slide showing half dozen screenshots from the TV
> show showing the work's progression from start to end. And here the link to
> the video for your viewing. Again it starts at 4minutes. Tom
