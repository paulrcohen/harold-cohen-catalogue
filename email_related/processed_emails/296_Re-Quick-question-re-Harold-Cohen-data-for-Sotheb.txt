Robert, I'm sorry it's a pain but yes, I think our best path is the one
you suggest.

This has been a surprisingly rich learning experience (how's that for a
positive spin!) particularly this most recent issue. It is sure to happen
again, or something similar that could cause a token to be withdrawn, so I
wonder whether there's any general method to deal with these cases. For
example, is there any notion of a provisional NFT or does that undermine
the whole idea of NFTs. When I buy a house, I sign one contract saying
that I intend to buy it, but this isn't the contract that formalizes
ownership. That comes later, after various inspections are passed.
