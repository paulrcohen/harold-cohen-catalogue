Hey Tom, thanks for the invoice, which I just paid. I'm flying to London
tonight and I'll see Michael on Wednesday, so we'll know more then. I'll
see what he really needs. Good going on all the copying! We'll be glad of
it in future!

I guess the next big thing will be sales of software, so can you remind me
where the software catalog is at? I know you made some good progress a few
weeks ago. I'm meeting Anthropic (the AI company that underwrote the Tate
show) on Wednesday and they seem interested.
