 Hello, Tom.Yes, this is something I can take care of for your client's insurance appraisal.Is it just the one painting?  The project will fall within my 3-hour-minimum for a review of the current value of the painting and document preparation.  The cost will be $1200. ($400 per hour x 3).
If your client would like me to proceed, I will need the following: 
 - an image of the painting, the title, medium & size. 

 - A copy of the original invoice, which I am guessing you may have on file. 

 - The client's name and address. 

 - The location of the artwork
Attached is a basic overview of fees and procedures.If I can be of assistance, I trust you or your client will let me know.Michael Maloney

Dear Micheal,This is Tom Machnik of the Harold Cohen Trust. Back in 2016 and 2017 you did an appraisal of our inventory after Harold Cohen’s passing. We have a request from an individual who has one of Harold Cohen’s paintings. He is planning to move the painting from California to Colorado and is seeking an appraisal of the work in order to insure it properly for transport. Is this something you could do for him? If not, do you have a recommendation of someone who could a proper appraisal?
