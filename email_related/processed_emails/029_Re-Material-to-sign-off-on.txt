Hi both,

Sorry for the delay and thank you so much for your further research into
this Tom and your further thoughts Paul.
I wasn't able to get hold of Michael as planned on Friday, so am hoping to
get hold of him this pm (when New York wakes up) - ideally before our 3pm
(UK time) call Paul so I'll have something to update you with!

I think your suggested wording might be the one to stick with:
*Each work is from a unique, signed edition with no other editions
available with an accompanying ERC-721 token.*

I would argue that this statement is true at this present time.
If tomorrow comes, and there will be another edition (produced or found) to
sell with an accompanying ERC-721 token, only then the statement will be
false.

To further protect ourselves, we could word it as:
*Each work is from a unique, signed edition with no other editions
available with an accompanying ERC-721 token.*

I'll try and get hold of him before our call, Paul.
Hopefully we can still salvage this and apologies for the frustration
caused here - we did everything we could on our end.

More soon,
Mila
