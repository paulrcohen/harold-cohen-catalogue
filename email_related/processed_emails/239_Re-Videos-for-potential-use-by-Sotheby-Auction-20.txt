Mila,
Here is some images of Harold and studio shots. They are a bit later 
than 2004. And I haven't found the uncatalogued ones yet that I see in 
my head. The shipper will be arriving in a few minutes. But I will 
continue to look for them as time permits. But I wanted to give you 
something in case you have a time limit, Tom
