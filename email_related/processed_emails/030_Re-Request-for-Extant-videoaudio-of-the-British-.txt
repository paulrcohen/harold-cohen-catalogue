Dear Andrew,Thank you for the list. I know it is not much but every little be helps. I am familiar with "It'll Never Work" as we have this programme on VHS tape. We also have a VHS tape of "Knowledge Talks: The Turing Test" but I did not have the date of the work so the date was very helpful. In regards to "Open University: Artware..." We have a tape with a printed label. Some of the text is difficult to read but it might read as:
A.LAW BBC OPEN UNIVERSITY ?OUM535A M206/TV10This is a PAL format VHS and since we only have NTSC equipment I have yet to view it. There is a date of on the tape being 17/1/97. Based on this limited information, can you tell if this is the same programme as the Open University 24/04/97? If not, might you be able tell me what this programme is about? 

In regards to the Newsnight 07/06/83 programme. This the first time to learn of this one. Cohen was in London around that time for a show at the Tate. Can you tell if the "Item on Computer Art" was filmed at the Tate Museum on our about the date of airing? In other words, is there a way to know where & when the filming took place?
