Hi Paul,Here is my invoice for my Dec 2024 hours. I received an email from Michael from Gazelli regarding the shipment. So hopefully the work will be shipped soon. Regarding the 3 mysterious pieces. I looked through all our recovered historical data so as to find 2000-2001 AARON generated files. There are 3+dozen of these files and are not viewable by conventional means. As time permits I am translating the drawing portion of these files so they can be rendered by conventional means. It probably best to do this anyway but I am also hoping to find the AARON generated work for these 3 mysterious one. Or at least strong evidence that these were AARON generated and not an unknown person's conjuring.
Tom
