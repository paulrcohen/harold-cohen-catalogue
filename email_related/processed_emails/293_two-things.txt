Hi Tom, just a couple of followup things from my meeting with Mila this
morning.

I understand that you inventoried roughly 4000 works and there are still
some to be done. Knowing that it'll take a while to do the remaining
inventory, what do you think of the following idea: Could you make a rough
classification of what remains to be inventoried? Here's my thinking: We
need a five-year plan for raising prices, so we need to know the whole
inventory, but we're most concerned about high-valued works, and
particularly how many we have (i.e., rarity). If you knew, for example,
that we have 20 paintings in a particular category, then for the purpose of
strategic planning we wouldn't need to inventory them immediately, because
just knowing that there are 20 would be hugely helpful. What do you think?

The other topic is storage. We're both concerned about storing work in the
house simply because the house is old and not very secure. Again wrt
high-value work we could ship more of it to London (or New York if Mila
does in fact open a gallery there) or to local safe storage in San Diego.
What do you think?
