Hi Tom,

Thank you so much for this.

If none of the images are exactly the same, then why do you think he
editioned them?
I've mentioned this in the other email just now too, do we know if any of
the other 'editions' of the 9 works selected were/are signed?
Paul, let me have a chat with Michael as I mentioned, will report back with
how we can navigate this as I think it is a matter of getting the wording
right so it is not misleading but also comforts both parties.
Will have a think about it but in the meantime, might something like this
be more in line with what we are trying to say? :
*Each work is a unique, signed edition with no other editions available
with an accompanying ERC-721 token.*

My best,
Mila
