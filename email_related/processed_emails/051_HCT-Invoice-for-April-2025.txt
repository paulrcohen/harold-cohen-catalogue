Hi Paul,Please find attached by invoice for April 2025 work. Maybe sometime soon we can have a call to review the San Diego Airport show. Also, I don’t know if you have seen but UCSD is looking to honor Harold next year. I forwarded a email to you. They were using team@haroldcohentrust.org and I’m not sure if you check it. Micheal is pushing the shipment along. Hopefully that will happen soon.
Tom
