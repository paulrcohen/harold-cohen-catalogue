George,This is what I think. At first glance I would say, the photo of the work initialed by Harold as "HC 72" may have been signed by Harold in 1972, but it is highly unlikely it would have been plotted in 1972. 1972 was characterized by plotted Maze drawings. Drawings plotted on his first generation of plotters. Again at first glance I would put this in 1969 and possibly a transition work from away from Contours. 
Upon second glance, because it is initialed and had not formally signed it, in a sense has a different meaning to Harold. So I need to think outside of the box on this one. For example, I recall seeing pages and pages of notes in Harold’s notebooks of number drawn in the style similar to the ones in the “HC 72.”
