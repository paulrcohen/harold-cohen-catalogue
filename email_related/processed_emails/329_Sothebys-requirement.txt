Tom, can you confirm:

1) the nine works on their way to Sotheby's are all signed (and if they
aren't all signed, how many are)

2) For each work, can we say with reasonable certainty that it is unique in
the sense that there is not another signed work from the same edition in
someone's possession.

I think the answer to question 1 is that all nine works are signed, and the
answer to question 2 is that some of these works belong to editions and we
know or suspect that other works from those editions are floating around in
the big wide world.

Please let me know as soon as you can.
