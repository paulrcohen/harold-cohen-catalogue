Dear Michael,

I promised I would provide you with an update at the end of the day. 
This is the update.

I have yet to find any shipping documents of any kind. I did find and 
looked through the 1976 Edinburgh show put on by the Scottish Art 
Council. According to the show list, there were 3 similar works shown 
but none match the size nor the description. So I think we can rule that 
out.

I did, however, find a group of previously unscanned 35mm slides that 
claim to be associated with the (British) Arts Council. Unfortunately 
there are no dates but I assume these are inventory storage photographs. 
All the slides are numbered but set into two groups:Â  'S' and 'R'. The 
'S' group are stretched works and the 'R' are rolled. I was able to find
