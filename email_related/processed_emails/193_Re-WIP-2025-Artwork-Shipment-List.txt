Hey Tom,

Many thanks for sending this over, and for all your hard work getting it
together.

I appreciate that this is a work in progress, so maybe it will be updated,
but there are Painting Machine works included on your list that are already
with us in London. I think the attached document I sent earlier is what you
have in California to ship?

With warmest wishes,

George Barker
