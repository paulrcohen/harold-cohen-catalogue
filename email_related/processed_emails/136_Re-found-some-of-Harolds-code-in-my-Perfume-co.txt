Sorry it took so long to scan the printed code pages. To give a background. I met Harold in August 1981 through his studio assistant Jeff Greenberg. Harold generously gave me access to his computer and studio and I was in the studio from around September 1981 to possibly 1984 but in-between in 1982 desktop computers appeared so by 1984 I had access to desktop computing. I learned C language and Berkeley Unix on Harold’s system. I am not sure but I may have been the only artist who was given access. In the studio there were multiple terminals and I was assigned to one. Harold had his, and Jeff had his. During this period, I was visiting faculty in the art / photography program at Cal Arts, and at some point Becky arranged to have me teach a photography course at MiraCosta College. (thank you Becky)

So I learned C and Unix starting in the fall of 1981 and throughout 1982. It took me a while to figure out how to create an artwork on the system (PDP-11 with vector drawn data sent to a Tecktronix 4014). The printout has a date of June 17, 1982 but I must have completed the visualization somewhat earlier. So interestingly this printout is the only remaining documentation of this visual project of mine. 

I came across a visualization opportunity reading an article in Scientific American about thermodynamic diffusion of perfume molecular particles which when released from a perfume bottle (limited concentration) eventually are evenlly distributed in the next large surrounding space. Surprisingly I was fortunate to pick this topic as its the basis for how generative AI image synthesis are modelled on today. My animation visualization is the only one I wrote on Harold’s computer, and it took some time. As I was learning C, Jeff gave me so technical guidance.

The attached code can be of interest to Harold’s legacy as it documents the interface between writing the code on the PDP-11 and how it is then visualized on the Tektronics vector-base green phosfor screen. I have included some of my own code, but left out a number of pages to reduce the clutter. Here is a description of the some of the pages:
