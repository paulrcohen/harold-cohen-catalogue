Hi Tom!

We have had someone interested in the attached work for quite some time and
she is in LA next week and has agreed to come and see it before she commits
to buying it.
We can do the shipment for it onwards to her but will it be possible to
send it over to Rob's house this week at some point?

5946 Tuxedo Terrace
Los Angeles
90068

Happy to coordinate for someone to be there when you're ready to send and
also can pass the cost of getting the work over to Rob's onto the client.

I understand it's not framed and would be useful to know the edition number
of the one you have over there if possible?

THANK YOU.

My best,
Mila
