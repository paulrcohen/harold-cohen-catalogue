Hi Again,
Regarding the book, the cover looks like it is a reproduction of an Amsterdam lithography that was hand colored with colored pencils. I am in the middle of doing a major computer data backup which will take another 5 - 7 hours or so. After the backup, I will be able to access the files and determine if the cover is indeed an Amsterdam work. 

The last 35 pages of the book are a collection of AARON drawings that were generated from 1973 to 1982ish. Most  of the 35 drawings look familiar to me. I believe I scanned some of the original 35mm slides of them earlier this year. They too are in the process of being backed up and I am not sure if they condition of the scans are acceptable to being reproduced.
On page 127 of the book it reads, "All the photographs in this book, and all the drawings which were not made by the program, were made by Becky Cohen."
I am not exactly sure what Jeu de Paume's intent is or what is needed, but in case they simply need works from 1973 to 1983 then we should be able to provide them with something. I will know more after the backup is done. If they are referencing, the book then I rather think permission from William Kaufmann Inc is required

 Hi All, I think the correct title is The First Artificial Intelligence Coloring Book.  Attached is a poor reproduction (it's for sale online, which is where I got the image).  Is this what they are asking for? Do they already have an image and just want the credit line, or are they asking for a reproduction as well?

Hi both , 
They have now just requested to reproduce just the cover of the book (as realised it will take a little longer to get copyright for other elements of the book as originally intended). 
Would this work? (They are planning to have the title as “The first artificial colouring book” beside the image of the cover of the book. 
If all good, can you please confirm what the credit line should be in this case? 
Best, Mila

 Dear Mila,When I go into the studio on Monday, I will look at the physical book. But I rather think the challenge is that the works published in the book may have been photographed by Becky. Hopefully, by reviewing the book that information will reveal itself. I am not sure what is meant by "descriptions" in the text "works and descriptions relating to Harold". In any case, I will review the book on Monday.

 Would something like this work? : 
Images from the Drawing Book are limited to only works and descriptions relating to Harold Cohen. No other artist can be reproduced from the book.

Hi all, just landed in Boston. Great trip thanks toMila! Re the coloring book, penny Nii passed away last month, so I think that makes the living authors just becky, is that right? Do we know how many images or how much text they want? P


Dear Mila
Nice to hear from you.
I'm always happy to hear about interest in the colouring book as it is a treasure that has yet to reveal itself fully. 
Earlier this year we scanned the pages so from a practical stand point we have them. We've had multiple similar requests in the past but we had to decline each not because there are multiple authors meaning we do not have the copyright. 
I would love for Jeu de Paume to include portions of the book. But don't want HCT to get in legal trouble.
