Hi Thomas,

Thanks so much for the additional information you provided yesterday. We wanted to run a few changes by you which have been picked up by our team.

We noticed that the Birdie Taylor gallery is referred to online as the Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery online - should we go with this version? ie. Earl & Birdie Taylor gallery
We suggest using Harold Cohen Trust instead as HCT as believe this is clearer. Are you OK with this?
Should we change paper to Roland PQM-CRBW-33-50 paper? Or are you not sure if all prints are on this type of paper?
Some of the file sizes are slightly different to what you wrote when we double checked them on our end. See below for more information. Are you OK with these changes?
0309-03s (C3 AW50)

0311-32 (i23-3405)

Please can you and Paul approve these changes so we can send final copy to Sotheby’s. Please find attached copy for both the NFTs and the Physical Print Certificates and the images we will use to mint the NFTs.
