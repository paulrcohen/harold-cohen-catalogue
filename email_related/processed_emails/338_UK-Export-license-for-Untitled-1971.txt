Dear Paul,

Sorry we didn't get to chat again after our brief sit-down.

Attached here is a proposed affidavit / draft for a document stating that,
to the best of the Trust's knowledge, that the artwork was imported at some
point during, likely during the mid-70's / early 80's, for the purpose of
exhibition.

To confirm, the artwork in question is this one:
[image: image.png]
*Harold Cohen*
*Untitled*, 1971
Acrylic on canvas
213.4 x 302 cm, 84 x 118 7/8 in
(HC0174)

If you could review the attached, edit as you deem appropriate, and let me
know if you'd be willing to sign / have this submitted as part of the
application to the UK Arts Council, that would be appreciated.

Also any questions you may have about the application process, I would be
happy to answer.
Michael.
