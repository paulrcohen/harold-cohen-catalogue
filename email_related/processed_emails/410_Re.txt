Happy New Year, Paul!
Hope 2025 is off to a good start for you despite everything that's about to
happen.

Thank you for the card information. I adjusted the payment info on the
Verisart account.
I regret to say I have not been keeping up with HCT business, and I am not
sure if the Verisart account for the trust is serving any purpose at this
point.
It is still charging $29.99 per month.

Please let me know if there is anything I should do (like send you the
password to access the account)!

Best,
Sara
