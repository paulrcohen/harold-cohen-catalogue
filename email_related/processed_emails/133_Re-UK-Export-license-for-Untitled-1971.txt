Dear Paul and Tom,

I just wanted to follow up and say thank you both for your help here.

The Arts council (faster than expected) approved the Export license without
an issue or any follow up questions.

I'm certain the signed letter and the researched details that Tom provided
that were provided along with the application made a huge contribution in
this going through without contest.

Best,

Michael.
