Hi both,

Hope all is well!
Paul, looking forward to our catch up Monday but in the meantime wanted to
touch base to let you know that the exhibition is up and open and getting a
lot of interest.

2 works have now been sold with another 3 being considered. Once the
physical exhibition is over on Tuesday, the sale will continue online.

There was an enquiry from one of the top NFT collectors re the actual
program producing these (some technical questions). Is there anything we
can share in addition to what has already been communicated ? Perhaps some
images of Harold’s sketchbook or anything you might think would be
relevant.

Some images here:

And the link to the online sale here:

My best,
