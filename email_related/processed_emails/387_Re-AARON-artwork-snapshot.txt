Hi Paul,Thanks, that is a good question. Unfortunately, if there was an email, it has been deleted. I do see what you mean about rim. Thanks for pointing that out. I am now reading through the existing emails from around the same time which happens to be around 911.  Apparently Harold had a pinched nerve in need to surgery. There was an email from Deb Hendel and I thought maybe SANY0005 was part of their collection. But the email from Deb Hendel was to simply convey to Harold that Bob, her and their family were all okay.
There are many emails related to a show I didn’t know about previously scheduled for October 2001 in Paderborn, Germany — Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum. I don’t see this listed in the bio and never heard Harold mention this show to me. Harold was to go to the opening but was unable due to surgery to relieve a pinched nerve. The details of the show includes projecting AARON onto a very large multi-meter screen, run a looping video of Harold talking about AARON. Initially, KCAT was to be running but Harold sent an updated version. There was a lengthy discussion on printing works onsite making them available for sale. I am still reading through the emails to determine if printing onsite for purchase by museum goers actually happened or not. There was discussion of selling smaller works that could be rolled in a tube and sold for $100 a piece. There are also many emails related to the difficulties of printing quality prints.  The Museum has a link to the show at https://www.hnf.de/ausstellungen/rueckblick/kunst-aus-dem-computer.html. They claim that 7 physical works were shown. Maybe SANY0005 was one of them. I am working on reaching out to the museum. It would also be good to know if SANY005 was one of the ones show and if not what was shown and do they have any Cohen/AARON works. But it would also be good to know if they still have a runnable version of AARON.

 Hi Tom, I’m not familiar with the picture but there were a lot of them and I might have seen it but forgotten it.  The resolution is low so I can’t make out the weaving together of color groups, though I can see that it’s happening, which make me think it is probably authentic.  I’m a bit surprised at the bright rim of the pot; I don’t recall Harold doing that.  Who is the email from?  —P


Hi Paul,I have attached a snapshot of a framed print. The name of the file is SANY0005.jpg and dated September 21, 2001. I found it mixed in with emails from 2000-2002. I am assuming the SANY of the filename indicates it was from a Sanyo digital camera. Does this happen to look familiar to you? Or have any thoughts regarding this work? Tom<SANY0005 1.JPG>
