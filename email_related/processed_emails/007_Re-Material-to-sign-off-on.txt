Mila, of course everything depends on the definition of "unique", but if

a. They didn't specify uniqueness in the contract
b. Their definition of unique precludes us selling any other prints in an
edition
c. They waited until we've done all this work to specify that prints should
be unique

then frankly I don't care about damaging our relationship with Sotheby's
because they have acted unprofessionally and why would we want to work with
them in future? Moreover, I hold them liable for all our costs.
