Hey Tom,

Thanks so much for getting back to me, I appreciate it.

Is the good friend of Harold you spoke to interested in selling? It's
important for us to try and avoid the risk of Cohen's work appearing in
public auction, and we'd be delighted to have a conversation with them
about a possible sale. Either way, it's great that you've had the chance to
look through the inventory, and discovered one of the panels from 'The Age
of Intelligent Machines'!

It has been a real pleasure working with you all over the past few years.
It's been a personal point of pride to have been involved in helping
expand the audience for Harold's work.

Thanks again Tom, and everyone :)
