Hi Paul,Thanks for the list of items. Regarding a call to catch up, I'd like to keep Thursday morning open in case there is something urgent from Mila. But tentatively I could take a call Thursday between 1p to 4p Calif time . If that doesn't work, similar time for Friday. Let me know if either time works,

Tom

 Hey Tom, lots to discuss here!  We should have a call this week if possible.  Very briefly: 
 - When I spoke with an accountant she said HCT should be a business, not a Trust
 - I'm thinking about retiring from Pitt and moving to Boston (where Allegra and Hitch are) and focusing on the startup, HCT and writing (keep this to yourself please) 

 - I have started the complicated accounting that will enable HCT to file taxes, but it's gonna take a while
