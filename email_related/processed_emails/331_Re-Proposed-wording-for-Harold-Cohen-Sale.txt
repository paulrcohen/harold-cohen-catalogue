Hi Robert, thanks for all this good material. I'm not sure what the
"powered by Verisart" one was intended to be. It says it's a gif, but this
is what I see when I open it. Is this right?

The printed certificate mockup looks good, thanks. I scanned the QR code
and was taken to Verisart (abeit a private record) so that works. The
traits for the opensea NFT mockup are as we discussed. For Tom's benefit,
the traits describe the NFT, not the physical print. Traits do however
include the fact that a print is included. Traits are searchable.

I'm not sure of the purpose of the pdfs, two of them look like they are
parts of a contractual agreement w Sotheby's. For the one that deals with
NFTs, I assume this is where you will add the provenance/metadata material
you'll be getting from Tom? WRT the final doc, which includes the
certificate of authenticity, the NFT and the Configuration, I have a couple
of observations: 1) the second paragraph of the NFT will be slightly
different for most of the NFTs because the dates will be different and so
will the jpeg metadata, and because in one case we need to that the jpeg
was made by Tom in 2024. 2) In "professional bio" under "opensea
configuration" the first three paragraphs are separated by blank lines but
the fourth is not.
