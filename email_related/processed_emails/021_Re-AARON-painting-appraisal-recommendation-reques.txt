Dear Brigham
Thank-you for your inquiry. It is nice to know one of Harold's more
important works is alive, appreciated and well cared for. On your behalf, I
have reached out to an appraiser we have used in the past and I am awaiting
a reply. If you prefer, you are welcome to reach out to him as well. Here
is his contact information:
