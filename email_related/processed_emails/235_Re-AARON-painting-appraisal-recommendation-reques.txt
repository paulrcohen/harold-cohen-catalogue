Folks, this is from Paul, not HCT. Brig, I don't know whether George can do
an official appraisal and I didn't mean to put him on the spot. But George
prices Harold's work for sale through the gallery and could probably give
you a good idea of what it probably would sell for. If not, I think George
could recommend an appraiser.

One thing to keep in mind is that prices for Harold's work are rising,
thanks in large part to George and the Gazelli Art House.
