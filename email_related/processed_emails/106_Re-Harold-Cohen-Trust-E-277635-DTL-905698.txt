 Hi Thomas,
Thanks for getting back to me.  Monday, June 16 between 9:30am-4pm works well.  We decided that a site visit wouldn't be necessary.  The crew will have materials to prepare the works so they can be transported safely back to Los Angeles.  Can you please confirm that the attached list is correct and that there haven't been any changes.  What is the best phone number to reach you?
Best,Jeremy

Dear Jeremy,
Regarding a date, will you be sending someone prior to collection to assess the care requirements? For example we have a number of large dye on paper works that or loose and will need pre-packing before shipping. We have other works that are order an in need of pre-packing TLC.  The studio is behind the home of family that is part of the Trust. We need to limit the time between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm. If you are able to do pre-packing onsite and complete the work all on one day between those times Monday June 16th is available.
