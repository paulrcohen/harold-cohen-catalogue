Dear Mila,When I go into the studio on Monday, I will look at the physical book. But I rather think the challenge is that the works published in the book may have been photographed by Becky. Hopefully, by reviewing the book that information will reveal itself. I am not sure what is meant by "descriptions" in the text "works and descriptions relating to Harold". In any case, I will review the book on Monday.

Images from the Drawing Book are limited to only works and descriptions relating to Harold Cohen. No other artist can be reproduced from the book.

Hi all, just landed in Boston. Great trip thanks toMila! Re the coloring book, penny Nii passed away last month, so I think that makes the living authors just becky, is that right? Do we know how many images or how much text they want? P


Dear Mila
Nice to hear from you.
I'm always happy to hear about interest in the colouring book as it is a treasure that has yet to reveal itself fully. 
Earlier this year we scanned the pages so from a practical stand point we have them. We've had multiple similar requests in the past but we had to decline each not because there are multiple authors meaning we do not have the copyright. 
I would love for Jeu de Paume to include portions of the book. But don't want HCT to get in legal trouble.
