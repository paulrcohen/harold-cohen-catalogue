Hi Mila and Paul, I have seen similar imagery for all 3 including the HC initialed work that looks like a penciled sketch. We have a couple similar works from his art school days. I agree with Paul that these works are in shockingly bad shape. I would also agree with Paul about being cautious when claiming they are authentic. Even though they share a strong likeness to Harold's works, I would hate to be duped.

 Hi Mila, I don't think we should authenticate work without a lawyer standing by, but that said, the image that looks vaguely like a tree, initialed HC, is not like anything I've seen from Harold.  But that doesn't mean much.  Given the signature and the date it could be Harold's rough idea of what he was aiming for, but then I'd expect it to be in a notebook and none of the notebooks I've seen has anything like it. 

Whereas the two images called painting two and painting two almost certainly are Harold's.  We have the notebooks where he designed the numbers.  These works are in shockingly bad shape!
