Hi Brig and Paul,

Sometimes you get lucky. I am looking at Harold's digital files from 
Quickbooks that go back to Jan 1988. Unfortunately, we don't have 
Quickbooks to open it properly. But, using a text editor I believe I 
found the entry we are looking for.

900125__o>h_ch_ich_10000.00_gordon bell_ptg "on gauguin's beach"_

The way I read the entry is that he sold the ptg (painting) to Gordon 
Bell and received a check for $10,000. The entry of the date is 
1/25/1990 and the amount is close to what Paul recalled.

In quick books a few days earlier I see these additional entries that 
seem to be related to the delivery,
900108__mcc>o_mc_tra_46.76_harris ranch_lunch, taking ptg to Bells. corp 
to repay_
900107__mch>o_mc_tra_24.51_harris ranch_lunch, bell delivery_
900108__mch>o_mc_tra_19.79_harris ranch_lunch, bell delivery_

I feel confident that we could generate a bill of sale for you based on 
this historical information. I will, however, also now look into the 
hard files for further confirmation.

Tom
