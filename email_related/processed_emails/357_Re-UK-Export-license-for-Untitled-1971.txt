Dear Tom and George,

*With regards to the packing*, ideally, yes, the collecting agent would be
able to use a space in order to pack the works, at least for local transit.
Once we know which works are being collected, I will pick/schedule a
shipper and will put them in touch with you Tom, in order to schedule a
convenient day/time and help ensure the works are collected promptly.

The other points will need to be answered by *George/Mila*:
-Shall we send any posters?
-Shall we send any or all of the large framed works sitting on the floor?
-Shall we send Harold's last Fingerpainting?

Michael.
