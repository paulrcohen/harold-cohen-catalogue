Hello Thomas,

Thank you for the details.
I've drafted the final shipping invoice and attached a copy here for your
reference.

I've confirmed this with Brad Davis from Dietl and he should be in touch
regarding collection either later today / tomorrow (they have to check
their schedule and will work on a mutually convenient day to collect these).

If you could run your eyes over the attached shipping invoice and let me
know if you have any concerns, please let me know.
Please note that these descriptions and details are simplified for the
purposes of customs.

If there are any issues I'll be sure to update you.

Best,

Michael.
