Hi Mila, let’s talk tomorrow re the collector and what might be
interesting. I’m drawing a blank right now. Also let’s catch up re
November trip. I can do it for sure but there’s a chance I’ll have to come
back two weeks later so I’m thinking about wear and tear. Also software
and anthropic and catalog raisonne etc
