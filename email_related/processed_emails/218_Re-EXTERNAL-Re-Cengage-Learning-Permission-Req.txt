Dear Mr Devanathan, as far as I can tell, the image you want to reproduce
is not from the Gijon series. Moreover, AARON Gijon was meant for
projection, not reproduction. If the author wishes to work with the Harold
Cohen Trust to select an image that is appropriate for her book, please ask
her to get in touch with me at this email address.
