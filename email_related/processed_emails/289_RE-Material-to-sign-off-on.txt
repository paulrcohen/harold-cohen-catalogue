Hi Mila
As I mentioned previously, the V&A has one of Cohen's 2003 print. Here is the link
https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O114804/0305-08-print-cohen-harold/
The text they provide claims that the title is 0305-08 and that it is copy number 2/3 and that this work is signed.
It has has text on the the webpage that readsCohen insists that display labels and image credits for prints produced by AARON should read "Digital print by AARON, a computer program written by Harold Cohen". 
And the accession number isE.264-2005

 I am looking to see what other information we have regarding additional signed edition prints of the 9 Sotheby picks. As the V&S example was the easiest to find, I am sharing this with you now to let you know that there is at least one verifiable instance of an additional signed print in the collection of the Sotheby 9 picks. I will now start looking for digital documents of additional evidence. Physical printed documents will have to wait until tomorrow when I return to the studio.
