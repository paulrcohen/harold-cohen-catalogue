Mila,The first sentence is ok, I prefer the second sentence as shown:
Computer-generated drawing (1976-1978) by Harold Cohen, University of California, San Diego. This early artificial intelligence work was composed by Cohen’s first implementation of AARON (1974-1980) later called Primitive AARON.
  One sentence is ok. If additional information is more ideal, I prefer what I shared here.

 Hi Tom, 
Following your notes, they got inspired and  suggested to include a revised caption as per below:  
Computer-generated drawing (1976-1978) by Harold Cohen, University of California, San Diego. The drawing was probably made with the help of his artificial intelligence AARON that was published first in 1979.
If this won’t work, then they will include the original plus the date: Computer-generated drawing (1976-1978) by Harold Cohen, University of California, San Diego.
I believe the original plus the date works better but let me know what you think!

Hi Tom, 
This is all super useful - thank you! I have passed it on. I have relayed to them, that if they need to feature the date, it would be best to include 1976-1978. 
My best, Mila

 Mila,I was not able to determine the year. The particular style is from 1976 to 1980/82ish. With the production date more likely closer to 1976 than 1982. The fact that the original caption does not include AARON suggests it is certainly much closer to 1976. Harold didn’t mention AARON publicly until 1979 in his paper What is an Image? Some of the motifs suggest the work was produced during the Documenta show 1977 or prior to.  If you have to put a date I suggest circa 1976-1978. 
Let me know what you think,Tom

 Hi Tom,
Thank you for this.Which year would it be best to attribute the work to - 1983 or 1984?

﻿ Hi Mila,I found quite a bit of information in our archives related to Herbert W Franke all of which can be viewed herehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14_kJAIaaMPWWQzCWQ3BJ09d452HCPYzu?usp=share_link
The most important find is a copy of Franke’s book with Harold’s images on page 120 along with the original caption — see attached. Instead of changing the caption, let’s go with the original since we have to assume Harold was okay with the original at that time as I found no objections in subsequent exchanges between Franke and Harold. -Tom

 Hi Tom!
Hope all is well.
Unfortunately they don’t have much more information on the works:There are 2 works, but they could belong in a set.They are sure these are real plots that are fixed on a carton. 
They said Harold’s image is published in the 1985 Springer edition page 120 (attached) 
They can use the published image with the same caption adding ~1983 or ~1984. 
They’ll need a response by end of tomorrow (29th) to make their publishing deadline.
My best, Mila

Hi MilaThanks for the quick reply. Do you know if these were two distinct images and not intended to be one work? Also it sounds like you are saying they still have the original art works Harold sent. Do you believe that is true? If so I wonder is there is anything written on the back. Tom
