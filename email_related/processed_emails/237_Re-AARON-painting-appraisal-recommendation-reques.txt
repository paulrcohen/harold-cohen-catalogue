Hi Brig, actually the email was from Tom Machnik, not me; thanks Tom!

Michael Maloney appraised Harold's estate right after he died for tax
purposes so the appraisals were low and the recent increase in prices
wasn't reflected. It might be more accurate to ask the Gazelli Art House,
which represents the Harold Cohen Trust, for a reference for an appraiser.
