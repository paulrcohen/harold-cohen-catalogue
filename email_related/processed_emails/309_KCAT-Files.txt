Hi Bre,It’s rather late but happy New Year! Hope all is well there. I am working on identifying some of Harold Cohen’s prints here in the studio. And I have this outlier for it has an unusual characteristic I have never seen in an AARON print. I looked through everything we have that is photographed. I still have plenty to look through that is not photographed but that would take sometime. I recalled that you had generated a rather large body of AARON KCAT drawings in prep of the Whitney. Any chance you still have them? And if so, could I somehow peruse them? If they have color that’s ok but for what I am doing, I really don’t need the coloring just the lines. 
Hard to believe a year has already spun by since we were all there at the Whitney watching your machines run. I’m looking forward to visiting your shop sometime in the future.
