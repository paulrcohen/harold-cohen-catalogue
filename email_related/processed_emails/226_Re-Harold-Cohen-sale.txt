Hello Paul

Nice to hear from you. Of course, I’d be very glad to contribute to this in any way I can - sounds fascinating, and entirely appropriate too. So, do count me in!

Do you have Pip’s email at UCL? It’s p.laurenson@ucl.ac.uk<mailto:p.laurenson@ucl.ac.uk>

Best wishes, and good luck with the application!

Doug

Hi Doug, first I must apologize for a very close deadline. I just learned of this opportunity from the Schmidt Sciences<https://schmidtsciences.smapply.io/prog/humanities_and_artificial_intelligence_virtual_institute_havi_/> foundation. A few months ago I proposed to one of the LLM companies a “21st Century Catalogue Raisonne” built around Harold. That proposal looks like it will go forward, but slowly, so I am proposing the same to Schmidt, except I want to build something not just for Harold’s CR but for any artist who wants it. I am trying to assemble a consortium of experts on very short notice and I am hoping that I can tempt you to participate. Christiane Paul and Mila are on board, as are Bre Pettis and Tom Machnik. I’m trying to get in touch with Pip Laurensen but no luck so far.

The pre-proposal is due on Friday. It’s only three pages and is well in hand. I wouldn’t need anything from you until they accept the pre-proposal and give us 60 days to write the full proposal. I have attached the original proposal to the LLM company (please don’t share it) to give you a sense of what the Schmidt pre-proposal will say.

I do hope you can participate, I think this could be a really interesting project.

Thanks! —Paul



Hi Paul

Nice to hear from you, and I'm glad the information was useful. I imagine it's a nightmare tracking everything Harold produced.

I'll be away for a few days from 24-27 Nov but hopefully we might still be able to meet up!

Best wishes

Doug

Hi Doug, thanks for your email. I hope you are keeping well. Perhaps we'll bump into each other around the Electric Dreams show? I plan to be there for a couple of days.

Thanks for your eagle eye on these prints. The whole experience has been interesting and edifying. Harold didn't keep the best records, so Tom Machnik, Harold's studio manager, cc'd here, labored long to track down editions and provenance. Your notes on the above are super helpful, thank you!

Looking forward to seeing you in late November if you are around.
