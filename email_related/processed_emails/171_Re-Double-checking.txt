Hi Paul

Tate got back to me and said "I'm wondering if perhaps it's already been
cleared with Becky then, as it was in a folder created by a colleague of
mine. I have reached out but with it being Friday I suspect I won't hear
from her until Monday morning.

This image will be used online like the others - we were aiming for the
project to go live by today, however there has been a slight delay. But if
we could know by Monday afternoon/early next week before the opening that
would be great!"

Many thanks
