Hi Michael,
yes, once we know the entire list we can proceed with a scheduling. 
Typically they send someone out first to get a lay of the land and then 
based on that they then schedule the pick. And if two visits are 
necessary that's ok. I just hope we can minimize the window of time as 
much as possible as to when the art is ready to go here and when they 
pick it up. Thanks for your cooperation and hope you have a wonderful 
holiday season,

Tom
