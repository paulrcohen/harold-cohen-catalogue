Roger that.

I think the panorama large plotter would work. I am confident that we could
come up with a solution to put it on the wall.

I think unattended won’t work. I can’t expect a mass produced 2d printer to
work unattended!

Open to ideas and happy to help. Bigger problems and visions are definitely
possible with time and budget!

Glad you got the magazine, I’m very happy with it!
