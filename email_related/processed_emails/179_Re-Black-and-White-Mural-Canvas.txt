Hi George,
Based on what I am doing, I’m thinking it best to hold off on B/W one for the time being. One of the ongoing documents I am working on is titled: Public Art, Murals and very large works.   https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rhZTswn58O6EDT6io6fPWgQyIb8_3Bdbt_YoPB0OFwE/edit?usp=sharing
Slide 12 shows the B/W workSlide 13 shows a 1981 Dye Painting on sheet clothSlide 15 shows one panel of a multi-panel work 
It would be best for my research to have all of these similar works together until I can finish going through all the additional panels. 
These are my thoughts,
