Dear Mr. Cohen,

We are writing to inquire whether permission would be granted for the use of the requested image.

Please review the attached letter and, if you agree to the terms, indicate your approval by signing and emailing back both pages of the document.

We would also require a high-resolution image at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
