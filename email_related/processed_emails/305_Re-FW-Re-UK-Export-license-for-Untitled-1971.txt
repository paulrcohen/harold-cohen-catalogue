Hi Tom,

Great to hear from you.

I've attached the shipping document for the 18 Figurative works on canvas
that fit within your 6 parameters. I have attached a list which has images,
plus the link here:
https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/f5fcb1f56f9ce5a013b84a/
<https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/f5fcb1f56f9ce5a013b84a/>.

Not to distract from the shipping project, but can you also please check if
there are any additional works with you that fit your parameters that are
not listed here?

Regarding the Painting Machine works. We have a total of 18 in London. This
list includes sold works, plus two that are consigned from Tom Gruber.
Here's the list: https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/237bf664d6efbf6f724c20/

According to your document 'Preliminary WIP', you have 17 works remaining
in the HCT collection? They are TCM5, TCM7, TCM8, TCM9, TCM10, TCM12,
TCM13, TCM18, TCM24, TCM25, TCM27 (signed and framed), TCM101, TCM102,
TCM104, TCM105, TCM106, TCM108. I have put together a document with the
images and titles attached.

Can you please include these works with the shipment of the figurative
canvas too? Our timeframe would be in the early New Year, if possible?

As always, we are here to help, so please do get in touch with any
outstanding questions or concerns.

Very best wishes,

George
