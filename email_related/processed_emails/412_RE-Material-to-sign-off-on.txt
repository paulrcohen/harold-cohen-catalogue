Hi MilaIt is difficult to describe what it is that AARON does/did. The imagery generated is unique. The print is 1 of x and there was a 2 of x and 3 of x in some cases. So there maybe x of x instances of this uniqueness. Each work AARON generates is certainly unique in that AARON by Cohen's coded design does not generate the same work more once. It is unique in that it is signed 1 of x whereas no other print is signed 1 of x. The series is special in that we have never sold the digital image let alone the digital + print together. I'm not sure if including AARON in the text is appropriate but like I mentioned Harold's coded design of AARON assures us that AARON did not and cannot generate the same likeness of this same image even we ran it billions of times it would not generate this image again. The wording is a bit tricky because we may another print produced in his lifetime but it is certainly not signed as 1 of x.Â 
I am not in a disagreement of the use of unique as that is an inherent feature if AARON. I would like a slightly different wording with "only known" as all of our picks were chosen specifically because they were not the only known one. I do agree with the uniqueness use I am just not sure how to resolve the conflicting message in such a short sentence. But I will think about it.
