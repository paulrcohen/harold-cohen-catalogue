Dear Paul,

I’d like to call attention to the Gazelli shipment. The attached the Dietl shipper is still a matter of concern. You may recall that back in January we expressed our concerns to Gazelli because of their terms. I went back to Gazelli and asked for proof of insurance. Gazelli has since provided proof of insurance fro Lloyd’s of London. However, when I went back and reread Dietl's terms, I am still uncomfortable with them.  

The way I read the terms, it seems to say that there is absolutely no insurance unless it is specifically requested ahead of time AND pay both the invoice for their services and the additional insurance fees, and that they won’t honor any insurance claims unless that is done. This makes it seem as though, if we rely on our own insurance instead of buying theirs and there is damage or a problem, they won’t honor the claim or help our insurance company in any way (like providing information to support the claim.) 

I am also quite concerned with their wording with respect to the workers being onsite in the studio. If there are no problems then none of this matters. If we could be 100% sure there would be absolutely no issues then we would need any insurance. I would not be surprised if their wording was constructed in this way because of their past experience. If so, then this is an additional red flag. Even with the insurance from Lloyd's of London, I am still uncomfortable with Deitl terms. Seems like a can of worms potentially exploding into venomous snakes. 

If you see otherwise, please let me know.
