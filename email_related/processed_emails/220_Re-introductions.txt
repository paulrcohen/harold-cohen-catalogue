Hi Everyone,Thanks for the introductions. I will let Paul chime in regarding any potential San Diego visit by him. If you have a timeline or sorts, even a vague one, that would be helpful.

 Hey all,I'm very excited about all of this and can manipulate my schedule around, perhaps Paul's, who I'm guessing is the furthest away. When will you be in town?Nina


Dear Ceci, Thomas, Paul, Nina and trust,

Just taking a moment here to make introductions between us all. Ceci 
Moss is my dear colleague and director of the Mandeville Art Gallery at 
UCSD where I serve as an advisory board member. Thomas is Art Studio 
Manager of the Harold Cohen Trust, Nina is a former student of Harold's, 
UCSD MFA and of course Paul is Harold's son and a computer scientist of 
many roles including dean at Pitt and DARPA alum. (Side note: Paul, we 
started this convesation with the fact that Harold has been part of our 
curriculum in AI arts history units in our vis 142 class since I started 
here in 2004, a class in which we also discuss DARPA! There are so many 
neat serendipitous connections here... Nina is a backcountry neighbor of 
mine and knows my wife Paula from Warner Springs, where Paula is the 
public school art teacher... they have worked together in the past:-)

So that conversation has been about UCSD's recent attempts and plans to 
honor Harold's legacy here. The idea that had emerged was that we meet 
up in person and discuss further. So I am just throwing out intros at 
this point, and looking for thoughts as to a time line for meeting!

cheers all,
Brett Stalbaum
