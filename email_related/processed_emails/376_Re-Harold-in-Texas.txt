Dear George,I am continuing to work on your list of 15 works to potentially add to the shipment. And, I came across one which is not quite the same as the “HC 72” work that you asked about earlier, but similar. The one attached is i23-3014 (most likely your HC4014). This is part of folio of 4 works (folio also attached i23-3012 to i23-3015) all claiming to be silkscreen prints. Paul may have more thoughts since he reconstructed the Mazes. But I wonder if all those numbers both for i23-3014 and the “HC 72"  are actually expressions of what Harold was representing inside the computer program. Almost like a sketch of sorts.Tom

 I remember I shared an image of the attached a while ago, but have you got any record of something similar by Harold? Signed from 1972. It is kind of similar to the 'number plotters' of '69, but the jagged font is unlike one I've seen before... What do you think?

Hey Tom, 
This is great, thanks so much. I had a feeling Harold would've shown somewhere in Texas...!
Have a great weekend, 
George

 Hi George,Good to here from you. Yes, Harold did exhibit in Texas as part of a touring exhibition called “Mapped Art” curated by Peter Frank. Mapped Art toured from 1982 to 1990 and the Austin, Texas leg was the last one. I am not sure what piece or pieces toured. But I believe one piece was of a pre-AARON Map style work of Harold's. Possible a labelled Map work from the early 1970ish. I might be able to dig that information out if need be. 
BTW, Harold’s pieces owned by Thoma exhibited in their Santa Fe, New Mexico Gallery. Thoma may have a facility in Texas but as far as I know Harold/AARON has not exhibited in Texas with Thoma.
Here is the list of exhibitions related to Mapped Art along with the dates. It was curated by And below that is a link to the 
"Mapped Art” 
University of Colorado Art Gallery (May 2, 1992 to Jun 7, 1982)Toledo Museum of Art (Nov 13, 1982 - Jan 2, 1983)Arkansas Arts Center ((Aug 7, 1987 - Sep 20, 1987)University of Texas Art Gallery, Austin (Aug 31, 1990 - Oct 17, 1990)

And here is a link https://curatorsintl.org/exhibitions/8060-mapped-art

Hope that helps,Tom

Dear Paul and Tom, 
Hope you are both doing well? I'm doing some research on any connections between Harold and Texas but drawing a bit of a blank... I am looking for any shows he might've had or any collections there. I can't see anything obvious from the CV we have, but perhaps you might know? 
Looking forward to hearing from you, 
George
