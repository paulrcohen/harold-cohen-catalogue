Hi GeorgeCongrats on inadvertantly coming across your June 17, 1982 code with Harold's subroutines. This is fantastic! Thanks for sharing the details on you perfume molecule visualizer. Sounds very interesting how you used Harold's subroutines as part of your animation. It would be nice to get this running again to how Harold's routines played a roll in your 1982 code and see if there is any hints of AARON running in the background in addition to seeing what your visualizer did. So cool.
Â I will confer with Paul as to what would be best. My thoughts are... For our archives I would like the scanned 20 pages as a PDF but if it is not too much trouble having both the scan and OCR would be ideal. Knowing some of the names of Harold's routines might be valuable in connecting it to the notebooks we have and the oldest code we have.
Thanks so much George
Tom
