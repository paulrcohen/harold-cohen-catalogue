Hi Doug, thanks for your email. I hope you are keeping well. Perhaps
we'll bump into each other around the Electric Dreams show? I plan to be
there for a couple of days.

Thanks for your eagle eye on these prints. The whole experience has been
interesting and edifying. Harold didn't keep the best records, so Tom
Machnik, Harold's studio manager, cc'd here, labored long to track down
editions and provenance. Your notes on the above are super helpful, thank
you!

Looking forward to seeing you in late November if you are around.
