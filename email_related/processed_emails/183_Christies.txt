Hi Tom and Paul,

I hope this message finds you both well.

As you may know, I'm finalising the description for the upcoming Christie's
auction, which will appear on the auction page and the certificate of
authenticity. Could you please confirm whether this work is part of the
*Jungle* series or the *Eden* series?

I’d greatly appreciate your confirmation by the end of the day tomorrow, as
that’s my cataloguing deadline.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Created in 1987, Untitled (i23-3758) is a key example from Harold Cohen's
pivotal Drawing Machine era of works, and forms part of the celebrated Jungle
or Eden Series. By the late 1980’s AARON entered its fourth phase where
human figures were built upon a three-dimensional knowledge base of the
program. This series marked an important evolution in Cohen's practice,
generating complex compositions of human figures with foliage motifs that
had appeared in his work since the early 1980s. Using AARON, his
groundbreaking autonomous art-making program, Cohen algorithmically
prompted the generation of forms in a sophisticated space, resulting in
dramatically positioned figures stepping out of a complex jungle
environment. The plants are generated from a number of sophisticated rules
about morphology in terms of branching level, clustering patterns in leaf
formations, and plant size. The energy and rhythm of the composition
demonstrate Cohen’s continued exploration of how AI could emulate and
innovate artistic expression. [image: Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 17.17.34.png]
