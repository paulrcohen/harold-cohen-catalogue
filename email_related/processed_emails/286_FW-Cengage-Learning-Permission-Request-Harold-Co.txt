Dear Paul,

I hope this message finds you well. I received a licensing request, details included below, to feature Harold Cohen's AARON Gijon, 2007, in an upcoming digital learning project. Before responding to this request, I wanted to check in with you to see if the Trust would rather handle this request directly, in which case I'd be happy to connect you with Cengage, or more generally to see if you are amenable to this type of project. Many thanks for your thoughts, and I'd be happy to pass along any questions you may have regarding the project.

Best,
Micah
