Thanks so much for looking into it and tracking down the code, George! I think it would be most relevant to the studio, but I'm also always interested in having the information for my own research and records.

As to credits, the ones for software usually don't go to that level of detail (e.g. on tombstone labels), but I think it would be nice to either credit everyone who contributed to the code or make a distinction between animation / subroutines with individual credit wherever it's appropriate.

Thanks again, hope you're all well!
Christiane
