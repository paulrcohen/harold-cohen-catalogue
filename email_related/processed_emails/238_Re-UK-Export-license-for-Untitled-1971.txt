Hi Mike and Tom,

Please find attached the shipping list of figurative works on canvas that
we think are with you:
https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/f5fcb1f56f9ce5a013b84a/ These are to be
sent alongside the unrolled works mentioned in your previous email @Thomas
Machnik <zipnpup@yahoo.com> If you can send the rolls, we will unroll here
to save time. I remembered that there might be additional 'figurative'
works on canvas that have not yet gone on the spreadsheet too?

We would also love to have the remaining Painting Machine pieces you have
in California. Here's a list of everything in London:
https://privateviews.artlogic.net/2/237bf664d6efbf6f724c20 @Thomas Machnik
<zipnpup@yahoo.com> how many do you still have with you?

Looking forward to hearing from you, and let me know if you have any
questions.

George
