Mila, those photos would not be ideal as they are from Boston almost 10 years earlier. The link to the VHS1-10 video I sent has extensive footage of him in the studio at the relevant time. If you need a still image, we might have a still or two closer in time that are yet to be catalogued. I will look into it today, Tom
