Hi George,Good to here from you. Yes, Harold did exhibit in Texas as part of a touring exhibition called “Mapped Art” curated by Peter Frank. Mapped Art toured from 1982 to 1990 and the Austin, Texas leg was the last one. I am not sure what piece or pieces toured. But I believe one piece was of a pre-AARON Map style work of Harold's. Possible a labelled Map work from the early 1970ish. I might be able to dig that information out if need be. 
BTW, Harold’s pieces owned by Thoma exhibited in their Santa Fe, New Mexico Gallery. Thoma may have a facility in Texas but as far as I know Harold/AARON has not exhibited in Texas with Thoma.
Here is the list of exhibitions related to Mapped Art along with the dates. It was curated by And below that is a link to the 
"Mapped Art” 
University of Colorado Art Gallery (May 2, 1992 to Jun 7, 1982)Toledo Museum of Art (Nov 13, 1982 - Jan 2, 1983)Arkansas Arts Center ((Aug 7, 1987 - Sep 20, 1987)University of Texas Art Gallery, Austin (Aug 31, 1990 - Oct 17, 1990)

Dear Paul and Tom, 
Hope you are both doing well? I'm doing some research on any connections between Harold and Texas but drawing a bit of a blank... I am looking for any shows he might've had or any collections there. I can't see anything obvious from the CV we have, but perhaps you might know? 
Looking forward to hearing from you, 
George
